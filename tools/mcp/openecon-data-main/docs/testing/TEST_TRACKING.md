# openecon-data Test Tracking

## Latest Test Results: December 28, 2025 - Session 10 (Country-Aware Fallbacks)

### Executive Summary

**Result: 96 PASS, 0 WARN, 4 ERROR = 96% Effective Rate**

Major infrastructure improvements: country-aware fallback validation and smart provider discovery. This session achieved the highest test pass rate yet with proper country filtering to prevent cross-country data contamination.

### Key Infrastructure Fixes Applied

#### Fix 1: Country-Aware Fallback Validation (`query.py`)

**Problem:** Smart fallback found providers with indicators but returned wrong country data.
- Example: "Household debt Canada" → FRED returned US data (HDTGPDUSQ163N)

**Root Cause:** `_is_fallback_relevant()` only validated semantic relevance, not country matching.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `target_country` parameter to `_is_fallback_relevant()`
- Added country validation that rejects data from wrong countries
- Uses country alias normalization (CA/CAN/CANADA all match)
- Fallback continues to next provider when country mismatch detected

**Result:**
- Household debt Canada → Now returns BIS data for CA (22 data points)
- Consumer credit US → Returns FRED data (994 points)
- All country-specific queries return correct country data

#### Fix 2: Smart Fallback Provider Discovery (`query.py`)

**Problem:** Static fallback chains (StatsCan → WorldBank → OECD) didn't include providers that have specific indicators.

**Fix Applied:**
- `_get_fallback_providers()` now uses retired resolver module (330K+ indicators)
- Searches all providers to find which ones have the requested indicator
- Ranks fallbacks by confidence score
- Combined with country validation ensures correct data

**Result:** Fallbacks now discover optimal providers dynamically

### Provider Distribution

| Provider | Queries | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| World Bank | 29 | Primary global provider |
| FRED | 14 | US economic data |
| UN Comtrade | 13 | Trade data |
| Eurostat | 8 | EU statistics |
| ExchangeRate-API | 6 | Currency rates |
| CoinGecko | 6 | Cryptocurrency |
| IMF | 5 | International financial |
| BIS | 3 | Central bank data |
| OECD | 2 | OECD members (low priority) |

### Infrastructure Improvements Applied

#### Fix 1: Region Expansion - Balkan, ECOWAS, Pacific Islands, OPEC (`country_resolver.py`)

**Problem:** Queries for Balkan nations, West African ECOWAS members, and Pacific Island nations returned no results.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added 4 new region definitions with 50+ country aliases
- Added detection patterns for regional group mentions

**Queries Fixed:** Balkan, ECOWAS, Pacific Island queries

---

#### Fix 2: Consumer Credit Concept (`retired translator module`, `fred.py`)

**Problem:** "Consumer credit outstanding US" returned no data - system confused consumer credit with household debt.

**Root Cause:** Consumer credit and household debt are different economic concepts:
- Consumer credit = unsecured credit (credit cards, auto loans) → TOTALSL
- Household debt = all liabilities (includes mortgages) → HDTGPDUSQ163N

**Fix Applied:**
- Added `consumer_credit` universal concept with correct FRED mappings (TOTALSL, REVOLSL)
- Updated FRED SERIES_MAPPINGS for consumer credit variants

**Result:** Consumer credit US now returns 59 data points from TOTALSL

---

#### Fix 3: Eurostat Interest Rate Support (`eurostat.py`, `retired translator module`)

**Problem:** "Real interest rate Germany" failed - Eurostat EI_MFIR_M dataset not found.

**Root Cause:**
1. Dataset EI_MFIR_M exists but wasn't mapped in DATASET_MAPPINGS
2. Frequency detection was case-sensitive (EI_MFIR_M ends with uppercase M)

**Fix Applied:**
- Added 17 interest rate mappings to Eurostat DATASET_MAPPINGS
- Added EI_MFIR_M default filters (MF-LTGBY-RT for long-term government bond yields)
- Fixed case-insensitive frequency detection for monthly datasets
- Added Eurostat to interest_rate providers in retired translator module

**Result:** Real interest rate Germany now returns 71 data points

---

#### Fix 4: Semantic Validation for Indicator Matching (`metadata_search.py`)

**Problem:** "Reserve Bank of India repo rate" matched wrong indicator (8.3.1_CAF.BREVET.SUCC - education success rate).

**Root Cause:** Overly broad keyword substring matching in World Bank metadata search.

**Fix Applied:**
- Added semantic validation to `discover_indicator()` using `validate_indicator_match()`
- Both main path and fallback path now validate indicator matches
- Added central bank/policy rate distinctions to validation prompt

**Result:** Prevents wrong indicator matches for policy rate queries

---

#### Fix 5: Indicator Resolution Priority (`retired resolver module`)

**Problem:** FTS5 database search returned discontinued series (M10092USM144NNBR) before checking curated mappings.

**Root Cause:** Resolution priority was:
1. Exact code match
2. FTS5 search (returns discontinued series with 0.8 confidence)
3. retired translator module (skipped because 0.8 >= 0.7)

**Fix Applied:**
- Moved retired translator module check BEFORE FTS5 database search
- Curated universal concepts now take priority over raw database matches

**Result:** Consumer credit now correctly resolves to TOTALSL (current series)

---

#### Fix 6: Expanded BIS Banking Keywords (`keyword_matcher.py` -- since removed)

**Problem:** Banking category had only 50% effective rate - many banking terms not recognized.

**Fix Applied:**
- Expanded BIS INDICATOR_KEYWORDS from 17 to 35+ patterns
- Added household debt variants, policy rate terms, banking sector indicators

### Remaining Errors (10)

| # | Query | Root Cause | Fix Priority |
|---|-------|------------|--------------|
| 36 | Primary budget surplus Spain | IMF indicator not found | Medium |
| 38 | Pension spending percent GDP Greece | Eurostat DSD not found | Medium |
| 56 | Net trade goods services Netherlands | Eurostat dataset not found | Low |
| 58 | Inward FDI stock Ireland | Multiple datasets (clarification expected) | N/A |
| 75 | Private sector credit growth India | BIS data not available | Low |
| 76 | Household debt to income Canada | StatsCan vector not found | Low |
| 80 | Property price to income major cities | "major cities" not valid country | N/A |
| 93 | Poverty headcount Nigeria | No data for requested countries | Low |
| 99 | Global supply chain disruption | Abstract concept, not measurable | N/A |
| 100 | Russian sanctions impact | Abstract concept, not measurable | N/A |

### Key Observations

#### Strengths
1. **100% effective rate for Crypto and FX queries** - CoinGecko and ExchangeRate-API stable
2. **95% effective rate for Trade queries** - Comtrade performing well
3. **Region expansion working** - G7, BRICS, EU, ASEAN, Nordic, GCC, Balkan, ECOWAS, Pacific all expand correctly
4. **No timeouts** - Backend stable under load

#### Areas for Improvement
1. **Banking queries** (50% effective) - Need better BIS indicator matching
2. **Complex/derived indicators** - Need improved indicator resolution
3. **Eurostat DSD gaps** - Some datasets not available via SDMX

### Failure Analysis (7 Errors)

| # | Query | Root Cause | Category | Fix Priority |
|---|-------|------------|----------|--------------|
| 9 | Taiwan province GDP statistics | Political restrictions - Taiwan not in World Bank/IMF as "country" | Country | Low (known limitation) |
| 28 | 10 year government bond yield Germany | Eurostat dataset IRT_LT_GBY10_A not found for DE | Indicator | Medium |
| 36 | Public sector net debt United Kingdom | Multiple datasets matched - clarification needed | Expected | N/A |
| 54 | HS 7108 gold bullion imports Switzerland | Gold spot prices not available via standard providers | Known | Low |
| 87 | V4 Visegrad trade with Germany | List object attribute error (intermittent LLM parsing) | Bug | Medium |
| 89 | Central Asian natural gas production | Country/indicator coverage gap | Coverage | Low |
| 98 | Agricultural value added percent GDP Vietnam | World Bank indicator gap | Indicator | Low |

### WARN Analysis (Provider Routing Differences)

The 45 WARN cases returned correct data but from a different provider than expected. This is **acceptable behavior** as the system intelligently routes to available data sources:

- **FX queries** (8 WARN): Expected ExchangeRate-API but routed to FRED or BIS
- **Trade queries** (17 WARN): Expected Comtrade but routed to World Bank for trade % of GDP
- **GDP queries** (3 WARN): Expected World Bank but routed to Eurostat for EU countries
- **Inflation queries** (4 WARN): Expected IMF/Eurostat but routed to World Bank
- **Monetary queries** (3 WARN): Expected BIS but routed to FRED/World Bank
- **Fiscal queries** (3 WARN): Expected IMF but routed to World Bank
- **Complex queries** (3 WARN): Multi-provider queries resolved via alternatives
- **Banking queries** (2 WARN): Expected BIS but routed to World Bank/IMF
- **Labor queries** (2 WARN): Expected World Bank but routed to OECD

### Infrastructure Observations

#### Strengths Identified
1. **Multi-provider routing works well** - System finds alternative providers when primary fails
2. **Region expansion stable** - G7, BRICS, EU, ASEAN, Nordic, Visegrad all expand correctly
3. **330K+ indicator database** - FTS5 search finding indicators effectively
4. **No timeouts** - Backend stable under load

#### Known Limitations (Not Bugs)
1. **Taiwan data** - Political restrictions prevent Taiwan from being in World Bank/IMF as "country"
2. **Gold spot prices** - Not available via standard economic data providers (use kitco.com)
3. **Multiple dataset matches** - Some queries need clarification (expected behavior)
4. **Regional trade queries** - "Asia" and "Africa" need decomposition into individual countries

### Executive Summary

**Initial Result: 48/100 PASS, 43 WARN, 9 ERROR**
**After Analysis: WARN was false positive (test script bug) - True pass rate was ~91%**
**After Fixes: Infrastructure improvements for remaining issues**

This session ran a full 100-query test and discovered a test script bug that caused false WARN status. The actual system was returning correct data but the test compared "WorldBank" vs "World Bank" (with space).

### Test Results Analysis

| Metric | Initial | After Bug Fix | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------------|-------|
| PASS | 48 | 91 | WARN queries had correct data |
| WARN | 43 | 0 | False positive from string comparison |

| Complex Queries | 10 | 90% | Decomposition, time series |

### Infrastructure Fixes Applied This Session

#### Fix 1: GCC/Gulf Countries Region Support (country_resolver.py)

**Problem:** "GDP of Gulf countries" returned no results because GCC/Gulf wasn't recognized as a region.

**Root Cause:** CountryResolver lacked Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region mapping.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Added GCC_MEMBERS constant
GCC_MEMBERS: FrozenSet[str] = frozenset({
    "SA", "AE", "KW", "QA", "BH", "OM"  # Saudi, UAE, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman
})

# Added region mappings
"GCC": cls.GCC_MEMBERS,
"GULF": cls.GCC_MEMBERS,
"GULF_COUNTRIES": cls.GCC_MEMBERS,
"GULF_STATES": cls.GCC_MEMBERS,
"GULF_COOPERATION_COUNCIL": cls.GCC_MEMBERS,

# Added detection patterns
("gcc", "GCC"),
("gulf cooperation council", "GCC"),
("gulf countries", "GCC"),
("gulf states", "GCC"),
("gulf", "GCC"),
```

**Queries Fixed:**
- "GDP of Gulf countries" → World Bank (271 data points)
- "GCC countries GDP comparison" → World Bank (26 data points)
- "Which Gulf country has highest GDP?" → World Bank

#### Fix 2: Household Debt Concept Catalog (household_debt.yaml)

**Problem:** "Household debt to GDP ratio UK" incorrectly mapped to government debt indicators.

**Root Cause:** No disambiguation between household debt vs government/corporate debt.

**Fix Applied:** Created `/backend/catalog/concepts/household_debt.yaml`:
```yaml
concept: household_debt
category: credit
domain: finance

explicit_exclusions:
  - government debt
  - public debt
  - sovereign debt
  - national debt
  - corporate debt
  - non-financial corporate debt
  - nfc debt
  - external debt
  - business debt

providers:
  BIS:
    primary:
      code: WS_TC
      confidence: 0.95
  IMF:
    primary:
      code: HH_ALL
      confidence: 0.90
  FRED:
    primary:
      code: HDTGPDUSQ163N
      confidence: 0.95
```

**Queries Fixed:**
- "Household debt to GDP ratio UK" → IMF (5 data points)
- "Household debt South Korea" → Correct routing to household-specific indicators

#### Fix 3: BIS Policy Rate Synonyms (retired translator module)

**Problem:** "deposit facility rate" and "cash rate" queries failed to find BIS central bank policy rates.

**Root Cause:** retired translator module's interest_rate concept lacked these common policy rate synonyms.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
"interest_rate": {
    "aliases": [
        "interest rate", "policy rate", "central bank rate",
        "fed funds rate", "base rate", "cash rate", "deposit facility rate",
        "repo rate", "official rate", "key rate", "discount rate",
        "monetary policy rate", "bank rate", "lending rate",
        "ecb rate", "boe rate", "rba rate", "overnight rate"
    ],
    "providers": {
        "FRED": ["FEDFUNDS", "DFEDTARU"],
        "WORLDBANK": ["FR.INR.RINR"],
        "BIS": ["WS_CBPOL"],
        ...
    }
}
```

**Queries Fixed:**
- "Reserve Bank of Australia cash rate" → BIS (71 data points)
- "European Central Bank deposit facility rate" → BIS (8945 data points)
- "Bank of Japan policy rate" → BIS

### Verification Test Results

All 5 verification queries passed after infrastructure fixes:

| Query | Status | Provider | Data Points |
|-------|--------|----------|-------------|
| GDP of Gulf countries | ✅ PASS | World Bank | 271 |
| GCC countries GDP comparison | ✅ PASS | World Bank | 26 |
| Reserve Bank of Australia cash rate | ✅ PASS | BIS | 71 |
| European Central Bank deposit facility rate | ✅ PASS | BIS | 8945 |
| Household debt to GDP ratio UK | ✅ PASS | IMF | 5 |

### Remaining Known Issues (4 queries)

| Query | Issue | Root Cause | Priority |
|-------|-------|------------|----------|
| FDI flow to Nigeria | IMF routing | Needs FDI concept catalog | Medium |
| Real effective exchange rate Germany | Indicator mapping | REER needs provider mapping | Low |
| Credit impulse China | Derived indicator | Not available in standard sources | Low |
| Total factor productivity Japan | Complex indicator | TFP requires calculation | Low |

### Fixes Applied This Session

#### Fix 0: Test Script Provider Comparison (test_100_dec27.py)
**Problem:** Test script compared provider names with exact match ("WorldBank" vs "World Bank")
**Fix:** Added `normalize_provider()` function that strips spaces, dashes, underscores before comparison
**Impact:** 43 false WARN queries now correctly show as PASS

#### Fix 1-3: Infrastructure improvements (see above)
- GCC/Gulf region support in CountryResolver and LLM prompt
- household_debt.yaml concept catalog
- BIS indicator extraction with `_extract_indicator_keywords()` method

#### Fix 4: BIS Policy Rate Phrase Extraction (bis.py)
**Problem:** LLM returns "Reserve Bank of Australia cash rate" but translator can only match "cash rate"
**Fix:** Added `_extract_indicator_keywords()` to strip institution/country names from indicator phrases
**Impact:** Queries like "ECB deposit facility rate" → extracts "deposit facility rate" → matches translator

## Previous: December 27, 2025 - Session 6

### Executive Summary

**Final Result: 13/15 (87%) - Major infrastructure improvements completed**

### Infrastructure Fixes Applied This Session

#### Fix 5: Subject vs Reference Detection (indicator_lookup.py)
- Added scoring logic to distinguish indicator SUBJECTS from REFERENCES
- Example: "Money and quasi money (M2) as % of GDP" → M2 is SUBJECT (+5 boost)
- Example: "Claims on governments (as % of M2)" → M2 is REFERENCE (-10 penalty)
- This fix prevents World Bank from selecting FM.AST.GOVT.ZG.M2 (wrong) instead of FM.LBL.MQMY.GD.ZS (correct)

#### Fix 6: Indicator Database Integration (worldbank.py)
- Added indicator database (330K+ indicators) as PRIMARY lookup source
- Database has FTS5 search with subject/reference scoring
- Falls back to live API search only if database lookup fails
- This fixes all World Bank M2/M1/M3 queries

#### Fix 7: Enhanced Metadata Pre-filter (metadata_search.py)
- Added subject vs reference detection to monetary aggregate pre-filter
- Excludes reference-only indicators like "Claims on X (as % of M2)"
- Applied to ALL M1/M2/M3 queries across providers

### 15-Query Test Results

## Previous: December 26, 2025 - Session 5

### Executive Summary

**Major infrastructure improvements across 3 areas**

### Infrastructure Fixes Applied

#### Fix 1: Indicator Translation Fuzzy Threshold (retired translator module)
- Changed fuzzy matching threshold from 0.7 to 0.85 for short queries (<15 chars)
- Prevents "M2 Growth" incorrectly matching "GDP Growth" (73.7% similarity)

#### Fix 2: Money Supply Catalog (NEW FILE: money_supply.yaml)
- Created comprehensive money_supply concept with M1/M2/M3 aliases
- Provider mappings: FRED (M2SL), World Bank (FM.LBL.MQMY.GD.ZS)
- Added explicit exclusions to gdp_growth.yaml

#### Fix 3: Metadata Search Pre-Filter (metadata_search.py)
- Added `_prefilter_monetary_results()` method
- When query contains M1/M2/M3, filters results to only those indicators
- Prevents 38-option clarification for "China money supply M2"

#### Fix 4: BIS Coverage Check & Fallback (bis.py)
- Added BIS_SUPPORTED_COUNTRIES constant (66 countries)
- Early country coverage check before API calls
- Raises DataNotAvailableError for unsupported countries → triggers fallback
- Empty results now raise error instead of returning silently

### 5-Query Test Results

| Fix | Area | Passed | Notes |
|-----|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Indicator Translation | 3/5 | US queries perfect, non-US needs World Bank indicator fix |
| 2 | Metadata Disambiguation | 3/5 | China M2 now works! Pre-filter effective |
| 3 | BIS Fallback | **5/5** | 100% - Full success! |
| **TOTAL** | | **11/15** | 73% |

## Previous: December 26, 2025 - Session 4

### Infrastructure Fix #2 Applied: Indicator Search Prefix Matching

**Problem Identified:** Short indicator codes like "M2" incorrectly matched education indicators like "CM2" (school assessments) due to substring matching.

**Root Cause:** In `indicator_lookup.py`, the code boost logic used Python's `in` operator:
```python
if word in code_lower:  # "m2" in "cm2" = TRUE (BUG!)
    score += 3
```

**Fix Applied** (`backend/services/indicator_lookup.py`):
- Changed substring matching to prefix matching for indicator codes
- Added money supply synonym expansion (M1, M2, M3 → "money supply monetary")
- This is an infrastructure fix that affects ALL short indicator code queries

**Code Change:**
```python
# OLD (buggy):
if word in code_lower:
    score += 3

# NEW (fixed):
code_clean = code_lower.replace('_', '').replace('-', '')
if code_lower.startswith(word) or code_clean.startswith(word) or code_lower == word:
    score += 3
```

**5-Query Test Results**:
| Query | Status | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|

### Infrastructure Fixes Applied (Dec 26 - 110 Query Session)

#### Fix 1: Enhanced HS Code Parsing (Comtrade Provider)

**File:** `backend/providers/comtrade.py` - `_commodity_code()` method

**Change:** Added multi-tier HS code extraction:
- Tier 1: Direct numeric codes (e.g., "8703")
- Tier 2: HS-prefixed codes (e.g., "HS 8703", "HS8703", "HS chapter 30")
- Tier 3: Chapter references (e.g., "Chapter 27")
- Tier 4-6: Text-based mappings with partial match fallback

**Impact:** All 9 HS code queries now pass:
- "HS 8703 automobile trade" ✅
- "HS 1001 wheat exports" ✅
- "Pharmaceutical exports HS 30" ✅
- "Machinery imports HS 84" ✅
- "HS2709 crude oil trade" ✅
- "Chapter 27 petroleum imports" ✅
- "HS 85 electronics exports" ✅
- "HS chapter 61 clothing trade" ✅
- "HS8544 electrical wire imports" ✅

#### Fix 2: Province Decomposition Fix (Query Complexity)

**File:** `backend/services/query_complexity.py`

**Changes:**
1. Extended `STANDARD_BREAKDOWN_INDICATORS` patterns to handle country prefixes
2. Modified regional breakdown logic to not force Pro Mode when query matches standard breakdown patterns

**Impact:** All 3 decomposition queries now pass:
- "Canada unemployment by province" ✅ (240 data points)
- "Employment by province Canada" ✅ (240 data points)
- "Canada labor force by province" ✅ (92 data points)

#### Fix 3: Bank Lending Rate Examples (LLM Prompt)

**File:** `backend/services/simplified_prompt.py`

**Change:** Added LLM examples for lending rate queries

**Impact:** All 3 lending rate queries now pass:
- "Bank lending rates US" ✅ (38 data points)
- "Prime lending rate" ✅ (18,362 data points)
- "US prime rate" ✅ (18,362 data points)

### Phase 2: Data Infrastructure Fixes

#### Fix 4: NaN/Infinity Sanitization (DataPoint Model)

**File:** `backend/models.py` - `DataPoint` class

**Change:** Added Pydantic `@field_validator` to sanitize float values:
```python
@field_validator('value', mode='before')
@classmethod
def sanitize_float_value(cls, v):
    """Convert NaN/Infinity to None for JSON serialization."""
    if isinstance(v, float):
        if math.isnan(v) or math.isinf(v):
            return None
    # Also handles string representations: 'nan', 'null', 'n/a', etc.
```

**Impact:** All BIS/ECB queries now work:
- "ECB interest rate" ✅ (1385 data points - was HTTP 500)
- All BIS credit/debt queries stable

#### Fix 5: Supabase Constraint Violation Fix

**File:** `backend/services/supabase_service.py`

**Change:** Generate anonymous session ID when both user_id and session_id are NULL:
```python
if not user_id and not session_id:
    effective_session_id = f"anon_{uuid.uuid4()}"
```

**Impact:** Anonymous queries no longer fail database logging.

#### Fix 6: Null-Safety in Metadata Search

**File:** `backend/services/metadata_search.py`

**Change:** Fixed null-pointer exceptions when BIS flow metadata has missing fields.

### Phase 3: Search Infrastructure Fixes

#### Fix 7: Indicator Lookup Country Preference

**File:** `backend/services/indicator_lookup.py` - `_rank_results()` method

**Change:** For FRED (US data source), penalize non-US series when query doesn't mention another country:
```python
# Penalize series with foreign country names in title
country_names_in_title = ["canada", "china", "japan", "euro area", ...]
for country in country_names_in_title:
    if country in name_lower:
        score -= 15  # Strong penalty for wrong country
```

**Impact:** "bank lending rates" now correctly returns PRIME/DPRIME (US) instead of Canadian series.

#### Fix 8: Data Freshness Scoring

**File:** `backend/services/indicator_lookup.py` - `_rank_results()` method

**Change:** Prefer series with recent data, penalize discontinued series:
```python
if end_year >= current_year - 1:
    score += 3  # Boost for current data
elif end_year < current_year - 5:
    score -= 5  # Penalty for very old data
```

**Impact:** Prevents matching discontinued series (like LIBOR) when current alternatives exist.

#### Fix 9: Synonym Expansion

**File:** `backend/services/indicator_lookup.py` - `_normalize_query()` method

**Change:** Added synonym expansions for common terms:
```python
replacements = {
    "lending": "lending loan prime",
    "treasury": "treasury yield bond",
    ...
}
```

**Impact:** "bank lending rates" FTS search now includes "prime" to find DPRIME.

### Expected Failure (1)

| Query | Reason | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| GDP per capita ranking top 10 | Requires Pro Mode for ranking/comparison logic | Expected |

### Infrastructure Issues Identified (Dec 26)

#### ISSUE-002: Multi-Country Provider Routing (CRITICAL)
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Description:** G7 GDP query routed to FRED (US-only) instead of World Bank/IMF
- **Impact:** Multi-country queries may only return data for one country
- **Root Cause:** Router doesn't consider country coverage when selecting provider
- **Fix Needed:** Infrastructure fix in router to check provider country coverage
- **Queries Affected:** All multi-country comparisons involving US indicators

#### ISSUE-003: Country Group Expansion Incomplete (HIGH)
- **Severity:** HIGH
- **Description:** Country groups (G7, BRICS, EU, ASEAN) not fully expanded
- **Examples:**
  - G7 inflation: 3/7 countries (missing US, UK, France, Japan)
  - BRICS GDP: 4/5 countries (missing Brazil)
  - Emerging markets: 0/10 returned
- **Root Cause:** Group expansion logic doesn't handle all members consistently
- **Fix Needed:** Infrastructure fix in country group expansion mechanism
- **Queries Affected:** All queries using country group abbreviations

#### ISSUE-004: Aggregate vs Individual Results (MEDIUM)
- **Severity:** MEDIUM
- **Description:** Some queries return aggregate/regional totals instead of individual country data
- **Examples:**
  - BRICS trade: Aggregate BRICS total instead of 5 countries
  - EU inflation: EU27 aggregate instead of 27 member states
  - ASEAN GDP: "East Asia & Pacific" regional aggregate
- **Root Cause:** Query doesn't specify individual country breakdown explicitly
- **Fix Needed:** Improve intent parsing to detect "comparison" vs "aggregate" requests
- **Queries Affected:** Regional group queries without explicit comparison keywords

- `expand_region(region)` - Expands "G7" to ["CA", "FR", "DE", "IT", "JP", "GB", "US"]
- `is_region(text)` - Checks if text is a recognized region
- `detect_regions_in_query(query)` - Detects G7, BRICS, EU, ASEAN, Nordic, OECD, etc.
- `expand_regions_in_query(query)` - Combines detection and expansion

Supported regions:
- G7 (7 countries)
- G20 (19 countries)
- BRICS (5 countries)
- BRICS+ (9 countries)
- EU (27 countries)
- Eurozone (20 countries)
- ASEAN (10 countries)
- Nordic (5 countries)
- OECD (38 countries)

#### Fix 2: DeepAgentOrchestrator Enhancement
**File:** `backend/services/deep_agent_orchestrator.py`

- Updated `_analyze_query_complexity()` to detect and expand regions
- Updated `select_best_provider()` to prefer global providers (WorldBank, IMF) for multi-country queries
- Updated `_execute_parallel_fetch()` to pass `is_multi_country` flag

#### Fix 3: Orchestrator Region Detection
**File:** `backend/agents/orchestrator.py`

- Updated `_should_use_deep_agent()` to automatically trigger Deep Agent for region queries
- Region queries now get parallel processing across all member countries
