# Trade Data Reference (UN Comtrade)

This note consolidates the Comtrade integration guide and the HS code mapping that were previously spread across multiple files.

## 1. Integration status

- Simple import/export, commodity, and bilateral queries are supported.
- Trade balance queries work for a single reporter/partner pair (the service computes exports − imports after fetching both flows).
- The provider currently uses the annual (`freqCode=A`) commodity (`typeCode=C`) endpoint: `https://comtradeapi.un.org/data/v1/get/C/A/HS`.

Environment variables:

```
COMTRADE_API_KEY=<optional subscription key>
```

If omitted, the API still works with heavier throttling.

## 2. Supported query patterns

Examples that the OpenRouter prompt understands:

```
"Show me China exports from 2020 to 2022"
"US imports of product code 640110 in 2021"
"Vietnam smartphone exports from 2019 to 2022"
"What is the trade balance between Canada and US from 2015 to 2020"
```

The parser accepts either commodity names (“shoes”, “smartphones”, “oil”) or explicit HS codes.

## 3. HS code quick reference

Use HS codes when you want fine-grained control. The provider maps common product names to the following codes:

### Footwear & apparel

| Name | Code | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Footwear / shoes | 64 | All footwear |
| Boots | 6401 | Waterproof footwear |
| Sneakers | 6404 | Sports footwear with textile uppers |
| Leather shoes | 6403 / 640340 | Rubber/plastic soles with leather uppers |
| Clothing (general) | 62 | Non-knit apparel |
| Shirts | 6205 | Men’s shirts |
| Dresses | 6204 | Women’s dresses |

### Electronics

| Name | Code | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Computers | 8471 |
| Laptops | 847130 |
| Smartphones | 851712 |
| Phones (general) | 8517 |
| Televisions / monitors | 8528 |
| Semiconductors / chips | 8542 |
| Batteries | 8506 |

### Vehicles & transport

| Name | Code | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Vehicles (all) | 87 |
| Cars | 8703 |
| Electric vehicles | 870380 |
| Trucks | 8704 |
| Motorcycles | 8711 |
| Bicycles | 8712 |
| Aircraft / airplanes | 8802 |

### Energy & resources

| Name | Code | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Mineral fuels | 27 |
| Crude oil | 2709 |
| Natural gas | 2711 |
| Coal | 2701 |
| Gold | 7108 |
| Silver | 7106 |
| Copper | 74 |
| Aluminum | 76 |

### Agricultural staples

| Name | Code | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Wheat | 1001 |
| Rice | 1006 |
| Corn / maize | 1005 |
| Soybeans | 1201 |
| Coffee | 0901 |
| Tea | 0902 |
| Meat | 02 |
| Fish | 03 |
| Dairy | 04 |
| Vegetables | 07 |
| Fruits & nuts | 08 |

### Chemicals, plastics, wood

| Name | Code | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Pharmaceuticals | 30 |
| Organic chemicals | 29 |
| Plastics | 39 |
| Rubber | 40 |
| Wood | 44 |
| Paper | 48 |

Feel free to pass either the code or the friendly name in your prompt; the intent parser normalises both.

## 4. Country codes

The provider auto-maps common ISO alpha-2/alpha-3 names to UN numerical codes. A few frequently used mappings:

| Country | UN Code |
|---------|---------|
| United States (`US`, `USA`) | 842 |
| China (`CN`, `CHN`) | 156 |
| Canada (`CA`, `CAN`) | 124 |
| Germany (`DE`, `DEU`) | 276 |
| United Kingdom (`UK`, `GB`, `GBR`) | 826 |
| Japan (`JP`, `JPN`) | 392 |
| India (`IN`, `IND`) | 699 |

If you need a code not listed here, pass the ISO alpha-3 code directly (e.g., `reporter: "BRA"`).

## 5. API URL shape

The provider returns an `apiUrl` field in `NormalizedData.metadata`, masked to show where to insert the subscription key:

```
https://comtradeapi.un.org/data/v1/get/C/A/HS?typeCode=C&freqCode=A&clCode=HS&reporterCode=842&period=2018,2022&partnerCode=0&cmdCode=27&flowCode=M,X&subscription-key=YOUR_KEY
```

Copying the link from the UI allows analysts to reproduce the request directly.

The UN Comtrade API has been successfully integrated into your openecon-data application!

### What's Working

1. **Simple Trade Queries** ✅
   - Country exports (e.g., "Show me China exports from 2020 to 2022")
   - Country imports (e.g., "Show me US imports from 2021 to 2022")
   - Commodity-specific queries (e.g., "Show me US oil imports from 2021 to 2022")
   - Bilateral trade (e.g., "Show me US imports from China in 2020")

2. **Backend Configuration** ✅
   - API key configured in `.env`
   - Provider integrated into QueryService
   - OpenRouter LLM knows how to parse Comtrade queries
   - Health check shows Comtrade status

3. **Frontend Support** ✅
   - Charts display Comtrade data
   - Each message maintains independent chart state
   - Export to CSV/JSON works

### Known Limitations

1. **Trade Balance Queries** ⚠️
   - Currently experiencing issues when querying bilateral trade balance
   - Simple export/import queries work fine
   - Needs additional debugging for bilateral trade with BOTH flows

## How to Use

### Example Queries That Work

**General Trade Queries:**
```
"Show me China exports from 2020 to 2022"
"What are US oil imports from 2021 to 2022?"
"Show me US imports from China in 2020"
"Germany total exports from 2019 to 2022"
```

**Product-Level Queries (NEW!):**
```
"Show me China shoe exports from 2020 to 2021"
"US imports of product code 640110 in 2021"
"Vietnam smartphone exports from 2019 to 2022"
"Germany car exports in 2021"
"US imports of HS code 8703 from 2020 to 2022"
```

### API Details

- **Base URL**: `https://comtradeapi.un.org/data/v1/get/C/A/HS`

## Legacy Appendix: Original HS Reference

# HS Code Quick Reference Guide

## What are HS Codes?

The **Harmonized System (HS)** is an international nomenclature for the classification of products. It allows participating countries to classify traded goods on a common basis for customs purposes.

### HS Code Structure

```
XX      XXXX      XXXXXX
│       │         │
│       │         └─ 6-digit: Subheading (most specific)
│       └─────────── 4-digit: Heading
└─────────────────── 2-digit: Chapter (broad category)
```

**Example: 640110**
- `64` = Chapter 64: Footwear
- `6401` = Heading: Waterproof footwear
- `640110` = Subheading: Waterproof footwear with outer soles and uppers of rubber or plastics

## How to Use in openecon-data

You can query trade data using:

1. **Product names**: `"Show me China shoe exports"`
2. **HS codes**: `"US imports of HS code 640110 in 2021"`
3. **Mixed**: `"Vietnam footwear (HS 64) exports from 2020 to 2022"`

## Tips for Finding HS Codes

1. **Start broad, then narrow**: Begin with the 2-digit chapter, then drill down to 4-digit or 6-digit codes
2. **Use product names first**: The system has 90+ product mappings - try the common name first
3. **Check official resources**: For unlisted products, visit https://www.foreign-trade.com/reference/hscode.htm

## Example Queries by Industry

### Technology
```
"China smartphone exports from 2020 to 2022"
"US semiconductor imports in 2021"
"Vietnam computer exports using HS code 8471"
```

### Automotive

## Need More Products?

If you need a product that's not in the mapping, you can:

1. **Look up the HS code** at: https://www.foreign-trade.com/reference/hscode.htm
2. **Use the code directly** in your query: `"US imports of HS code XXXXXX"`
3. **Request it to be added** to the mapping for easier future use
