### Resources Implementation

The server should implement **1 resources** initially, with future consideration for:
- Market sizing methodology documentation
- Industry classification mappings
- Data source reliability guides

The current resource would be rendering the Readme file contents

### Error Handling Protocol

All tools must implement standardized MCP error responses:

#### Error Types
- **InvalidParams**: Malformed or invalid input parameters
- **InternalError**: Server-side processing failures
- **MethodNotFound**: Unsupported tool requests
- **RequestTimeout**: Query processing timeouts
- **DataUnavailable**: Missing or stale data sources


### Logging Requirements

#### Log Levels
- **DEBUG**: Detailed calculation steps and data source queries
- **INFO**: Tool execution summaries and cache hits/misses  
- **WARN**: Data quality issues and fallback source usage
- **ERROR**: Failed calculations and data source errors

#### Structured Logging Format
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "tool": "calculate_tam",
  "industry": "cloud-computing",
  "execution_time_ms": 1247,
  "cache_hit": false,
  "data_sources": ["government", "research_firm"],
  "confidence_score": 0.85
}
```

### Testing and Validation

#### MCP Protocol Compliance
- Automated testing against MCP specification test suite
- JSON-RPC 2.0 message format validation
- Tool schema validation with Zod
- Error response format compliance

#### Integration Testing
- End-to-end tool execution workflows
- Error condition handling and recovery
- Performance benchmarking under load
- Client compatibility testing
