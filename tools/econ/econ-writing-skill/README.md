## What Is This?

Econ Writing Skill is an open-source [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io) that gives AI coding assistants deep knowledge of how to write economics papers. It distills actionable advice from over 50 guides by John Cochrane, Deirdre McCloskey, Jesse Shapiro, Keith Head, Marc Bellemare, Claudia Goldin, Edward Glaeser, Michael Kremer, and many others into a single structured skill file. Compatible with the Agent Skills open standard, it works with Claude Code and OpenAI Codex out of the box.

## Key Features

### Writing & Structure

- **Works for all paper types** -- Applied empirical, pure theory, mixed theory-empirical, structural, and descriptive papers each get tailored structure and guidance
- **Dedicated formulas for every major section** -- Abstract (4-part formula), Introduction (Head's formula), Model Section (Glaeser/Varian), Data Section, Conclusion (3-part formula), Title (with evaluation criteria)
- **Identification strategy guidance** -- Specific writing advice for 13 strategies: RCT, DiD (including staggered), IV, RDD, Synthetic Control, Synthetic DiD, Bunching, Shift-Share/Bartik, Event Studies, ML for Causal Inference, Structural Estimation, Descriptive, plus guidance for papers using multiple strategies
- **Theory paper support** -- Model presentation, proposition writing, and Glaeser's "start with an example" approach

## Usage

Once installed, invoke the skill from your AI assistant:

```
/econ-write write introduction for my paper on the effect of minimum wage on employment
```

```
/econ-write rewrite this abstract to be more concrete and under 150 words
```

```
/econ-write draft a conclusion for my RDD paper on school funding
```

```
/econ-write review this paragraph for style violations
```

```
/econ-write help me structure the model section for my theory paper
```

```
/econ-write audit my full paper and score it
```

The skill works in four modes:

- **Drafting**: generates new text following the formulas and rules, marking areas that need your specific results with `[AUTHOR: ...]` placeholders.
- **Rewriting**: identifies violations of the rules (passive voice, vague language, buried leads, throat-clearing) and fixes them while preserving your meaning and contribution.
- **Reviewing**: checks existing text against all rules and provides a detailed report of issues with suggested fixes.
- **Auditing**: scores the full paper from three simulated reviewer perspectives and returns a 100-point rubric with prioritized feedback.

---

## Common Use Cases

- **Drafting a new paper section** -- Generate a first draft of any section (abstract, introduction, data, results, conclusion) that follows established formulas from the start.
- **Rewriting existing text for clarity** -- Tighten prose, eliminate passive voice, cut throat-clearing, and make results concrete.
- **Writing an introduction from scratch** -- Follow Head's formula exactly: Hook, Research Question, Main Results, Literature Review & Value Added, Roadmap.
- **Conducting and writing a literature review** -- Build a story-driven review of the 5-10 closest papers, embedded in the introduction, that establishes your paper's niche.
- **Writing up existing empirical results** -- Present results in the correct order (main result first, most parsimonious to least parsimonious) with proper emphasis on economic significance.
- **Writing a theory paper** -- Structure model presentation, write propositions with intuition before proofs, generate testable predictions.
- **Structuring a mixed theory-empirical paper** -- Map empirical tests back to specific model predictions.
- **Preparing a presentation** -- Get advice on slide structure, pacing, and delivery following Shapiro, Cochrane, and others ("Gene Fama usually starts with 'Look at table 1.' That's a good model.").
- **Reviewing a full paper** -- Get a structured audit with 3 simulated reviewer perspectives and a 100-point score.
- **Writing a grant proposal** -- Structure an NSF, ERC, or institutional proposal that sells a research plan, not a finished paper.
- **Writing for policy audiences** -- Translate academic findings into plain-language policy briefs and op-eds.
- **Converting a working paper to journal format** -- Cut strategically, meet journal length norms, organize the online appendix.
- **Preparing a replication package** -- Follow AEA Data Editor standards for data citation, code reproducibility, and README structure.

### `identification-strategies.md`

Detailed writing guidance tailored to each identification strategy: RCT, DiD (including staggered), IV, RDD, Synthetic Control, Synthetic DiD, Structural Estimation, Descriptive/Measurement, Bunching Estimation, Shift-Share/Bartik Instruments, Event Studies, and Machine Learning for Causal Inference, plus guidance for papers combining multiple strategies. Includes an introduction adaptation table showing how to adjust hooks, results paragraphs, and key threats for 13 paper types.

### `latex-tips.md`

Practical LaTeX guidance for economics papers: document structure, essential packages (booktabs, threeparttable, natbib, siunitx), regression table formatting, figure best practices (PDF vector graphics, subfigures), bibliography management, math formatting, cross-referencing with cleveref, journal submission requirements (AER, QJE, Econometrica, REStud, JPE), Beamer presentations, and common pitfalls.

### `review-checklist.md`

Structured paper review framework with quick-scan mode (5-minute check), deep-review mode (3 simulated reviewers: Methodologist, Field Expert, Writing Critic), anti-AI detection checklist, 100-point pre-submission scoring rubric, and journal fit assessment for top-5 vs. field journal targeting.

### `specialized-tasks.md`

Task-specific instructions for lower-frequency writing jobs that build on the core skill: conference and seminar presentations, survey/review papers (JEL, JEP, Handbook chapters), converting a working paper to a journal version, grant proposals (NSF, ERC, institutional), writing for non-academic audiences (policy briefs, op-eds), and referee responses for revise-and-resubmit. Splitting these out of `SKILL.md` keeps the always-loaded core leaner.
