# Cursor Chat Recording

## 2026-01-26

User request:
- Fix GitHub Pages rendering for skills so SKILL.md files become pages without manual index.md copying.

Assistant actions:
- Added a custom skill page layout and markdown styling.

- Scoped the skills layout to the `skills` path for consistent rendering.
- Created missing skill definitions: stata-regression, python-panel-data, latex-tables, econ-visualization.
- Added a GitHub Actions pre-build step to copy SKILL.md to index.md.
- Normalized markdown spacing to satisfy lint rules.
- Added debug instrumentation to skill page layout to trace rendering and stylesheet loading.
- Added inline debug instrumentation to the r-econometrics skill content for production logging.
- Added a homepage debug probe to validate client logging pipeline.
- Updated the deploy workflow to inject `layout: skill` into generated index pages.
- Fixed `baseurl` in Jekyll config so skill layout CSS resolves correctly.

## 2026-01-26 (Later)

User request:
- Explain line by line what `_config.yml` is saying.
- Fix navigation bar home link pointing to wrong URL (https://meleantonio.github.io instead of https://meleantonio.github.io/awesome-econ-ai-stuff).

Assistant actions:
- Provided comprehensive line-by-line explanation of the Jekyll configuration file.
- Fixed the navigation home link issue by:
  - Adding Jekyll front matter (`---\n---`) to `index.html` to enable Liquid templating
  - Changed `href="/"` to `href="{{ site.baseurl }}/"` on the home logo link (line 24)
  - Updated CSS link to use `{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/css/style.css`
  - Updated all submit.html links to use `{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/submit.html` (lines 31, 387, 486)
  - Updated JS link to use `{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/js/main.js`
  - Now the home link correctly points to `https://meleantonio.github.io/awesome-econ-ai-stuff/` instead of the root domain

## 2026-01-26 (Skills Catalog Refactoring)

User request:
- Remove the non-functional workflow section from index.html (clicking workflow-card items did nothing)
- Keep the Skills Catalog section but rename it to "Your Research, Supercharged!" with the same gradient styling as the old workflow section title
- Automatically generate skill cards based on SKILL.md files, categorizing them intelligently based on `workflow_stage` frontmatter

Assistant actions:
- Removed the workflow section (lines 95-139) from index.html
- Updated Skills Catalog section title to use "Your Research, Supercharged" with gradient-text styling
- Changed navigation link from "Workflow" to "Quick Start" since workflow section was removed
- Updated hero stats to say "Categories" instead of "Workflow Stages" and made skills count dynamic
- Replaced all hardcoded skill cards with Jekyll Liquid templating that:
  - Iterates through `site.skills` collection
  - Reads `workflow_stage` from each skill's YAML frontmatter to determine category
  - Maps categories to appropriate icons (💡 Ideation, 📚 Literature, 📐 Theory, 📊 Data, 🔬 Analysis, 📝 Writing, 🎯 Communication)
  - Dynamically generates skill cards with name, description, tags (limited to 3), and compatibility icons
- Renamed `skills/` directory to `_skills/` for proper Jekyll collection recognition
- Created missing index.md files for skills that only had SKILL.md:
  - `_skills/analysis/stata-regression/index.md`
  - `_skills/analysis/python-panel-data/index.md`
  - `_skills/communication/econ-visualization/index.md`
  - `_skills/writing/latex-tables/index.md`
- Updated `_config.yml` defaults to scope to collection type instead of path
## 2026-01-26 (Evening)

User request:
- On the landing page, add a button that allows to download all the skills at once, in a zip file, with the directory structure as is in the repo.
- Add a button to each skill page that allows to download the individual SKILL.md file.

Assistant actions:
- Created `assets/js/download.js` with functionality to:
  - Download all skills as a zip file preserving directory structure
  - Download individual SKILL.md files from skill pages
- Added JSZip library (CDN) to both `index.html` and `_layouts/skill.html` for zip file creation
- Added "Download All Skills" button to hero section on landing page (`index.html`)
- Added "Download SKILL.md" button to skill pages (`_layouts/skill.html`)
- Implemented base URL detection for proper file fetching in Jekyll environment
- Made `site.baseurl` available to JavaScript via `window.siteBaseurl` variable
- Both buttons use existing button styles (`.btn`, `.btn-secondary`) for consistent design

## 2026-01-26 (Fix Duplicate Skill Cards)

User request:
- Skills appear twice. The same skill is visible in two cards. This is probably due to the existence of an index.md file and a SKILL.md file for every skill. We added index.md because Jekyll seemed unable to use SKILL.md for creating a page in the website. Is there a way to avoid duplication of cards?

Assistant actions:
- Identified that Jekyll was processing both `index.md` and `SKILL.md` files as collection items, causing duplicate skill cards
- Added `**/SKILL.md` to the exclude list in `_config.yml` to prevent Jekyll from processing SKILL.md files as collection items
- Now only `index.md` files are processed as collection items, eliminating duplicates
- SKILL.md files remain in the repository for download purposes but are not processed by Jekyll

## 2026-01-27 (Fix Empty Zip Download)

User request:
- The Download All Skills button produces an empty zip folder. It should instead contain the entire skills folder.

Assistant actions:
- Identified the root cause: `SKILLS_LIST` in `download.js` was referencing paths starting with `skills/...` but the actual folder in the repository is `_skills/...` (with underscore prefix)
- Updated all 12 skill paths in `SKILLS_LIST` from `skills/` to `_skills/` to match the actual folder structure
- This fix ensures the fetch requests target the correct file paths, allowing the SKILL.md files to be downloaded and added to the zip file

## 2026-03-22 (GitHub issue #24 — README broken links)

User request:
- Fix GitHub issue #24 about the README (broken internal links).

Assistant actions:
- Issue: catalog and template links used `skills/...` but the repository stores skills under `_skills/` (Jekyll collection), so GitHub resolved links to non-existent paths.
- Updated README: all skill catalog links, `Skill Template` link, and the `cp` quick-start example now use `_skills/` paths so links resolve on github.com.
- Follow-up: removed three catalog lines (`game-theory-solver`, `referee-response`, `research-website`) because those directories are not present under `_skills/`; keeping them would still 404 on GitHub.

User request:
- Open a PR for the README fix.

Assistant actions:
- Branch `fix/readme-skill-links-issue-24`, commit, push to `origin`, opened PR: https://github.com/meleantonio/awesome-econ-ai-stuff/pull/26

## 2026-03-22 (README: remove catalog entries for missing skills)

User request:
- Verify and fix: README linked to `game-theory-solver`, `referee-response`, and `research-website` under `_skills/` but those directories do not exist; remove those lines; open a PR.

Assistant actions:
- Confirmed no `_skills/theory/game-theory-solver`, `_skills/writing/referee-response`, or `_skills/communication/research-website` in the repo.
- Removed the three bullets from README and clarified the earlier #24 session note in this file.
- Opened PR: https://github.com/meleantonio/awesome-econ-ai-stuff/pull/27

## 2026-03-22 (Copy ~/.cursor/skills into repo + engineering category)

User request:
- Copy skills from `~/.cursor/skills/` into `_skills/engineering/` (sdd, techdebt, commit-push-pr, code-simplifier), integrate the Jekyll site: new filter tab, `download.js`, deploy workflow `_skills` path, README/CONTRIBUTING/submit form, SDD bundle zip for templates + reference.

Assistant actions:
- Added `_skills/engineering/` with normalized front matter (`workflow_stage: engineering`), synced `index.md` from `SKILL.md`.
- Updated `index.html` (8 categories, Engineering filter + Liquid case), `assets/js/download.js` (SDD bundle constants, `general-equilibrium-model-builder` in zip-all), `_layouts/skill.html` (SDD full zip button), `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (`_skills` root), `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `pages/submit.html`.
