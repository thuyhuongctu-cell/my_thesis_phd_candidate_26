# Changelog

All notable changes to `overleaf-sync-now`. Versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## 0.4.0 — 2026-05-30

Hardening release from a deep multi-dimension audit. Closes the two
data-safety holes where the tool could fail *open* — silently letting the AI
edit a stale local copy, the exact scenario it exists to prevent — plus
network resilience, credential-storage, and packaging fixes.

### Fixed — data safety (the core guarantee)

1. **Missing/expired cookies now BLOCK the edit instead of passing it
   through.** Previously, only an HTTP 401/403 at request time raised
   `AuthExpired` (which the PreToolUse hook blocks on, exit 2). The far more
   common case — cookies expired, deleted, or never set — failed earlier in
   `get_session()` with a *plain* `RuntimeError`, which the hook's generic
   handler caught, marked-synced, and exited 0 on. So the routine reason sync
   stops working (an expired session) let the AI edit a possibly-stale copy
   and overwrite web edits on the next Dropbox round-trip. `get_session()` now
   raises `AuthExpired` for the genuine no-/expired-cookie case, so the hook
   blocks and the agent re-auths. A sandbox/socket block still raises a plain
   `RuntimeError` and passes through (auth is fine there; see 0.1.x). This also
   removes the misleading "will retry after debounce" message on that path
   (re-auth is required, not a wait).

2. **A protected (recently-modified) file no longer strands a web edit.**
   `refresh_project` advanced the cached `toV` unconditionally after
   extraction — even when a file was *skipped* by the 30 s recent-mtime guard.
   The cheap-probe gate (`latest_toV == cached_toV → no_change`) then
   short-circuited every future sync, so a genuine web-origin change to a
   file that happened to have a fresh local mtime was tracked as "synced" and
   never re-pulled. The version is now advanced **only when `n_protected ==
   0`**; otherwise it is held at the cached value and the pending web change
   is re-offered on the next sync (status reports `version held at <toV>`).

### Fixed — resilience & security

3. **Bounded retry on transient upstream 5xx.** `get_session()` now mounts a
   `urllib3` `Retry` (total 3, `status_forcelist` 502/503/504, GET only,
   `raise_on_status=False`) so a momentary Overleaf/CDN hiccup during a deploy
   no longer aborts the refresh (and, in the hook, lets a stale edit through).

4. **Data dir hardened to `0700` on POSIX.** The `0600` on `cookies.json`
   didn't cover the persistent `login` browser profile (Chromium-written,
   holding a weeks-long session) sitting in a world-traversable `0755` data
   dir. The data dir is now `chmod 0700` on write, and `login` also tightens
   the profile dir. On Windows, parent-directory ACL inheritance applies.

### Fixed — packaging & docs

5. **Version single-sourced.** `__init__.__version__` had drifted to `0.3.1`
   while the package shipped `0.3.2`, so `--version` lied. `pyproject.toml`
   now derives the version from `__init__.__version__` via
   `[tool.setuptools.dynamic]`; bump `__init__.py` (and `CITATION.cff`) on
   release. A test pins the three together.
6. **`playwright` Python-3.8 marker made explicit** (`<1.49` on 3.8, `>=1.49`
   on 3.9+), matching the per-dependency markering the rest of the table uses
   instead of leaving 3.8 resolution to resolver backtracking.
7. **Docs corrected:** SKILL.md auth-chain order now lists the `login` profile
   (step 2); the failure-mode bullet quotes the real `No valid Overleaf
   cookies` message and points to `login`/`save-cookie` (not `setup`); the
   data-safety paragraph documents the new version-hold; the security note
   lists the browser profile and the `0600`/`0700` perms. `authentication.md`
   and `troubleshooting.md` no longer hardcode the legacy
   `~/.claude/overleaf-data/` path as canonical.
8. **`doctor` now probes the same browser set as the live auth chain.** The
   browser-backend list was duplicated across four sites and had drifted —
   `doctor`'s rookiepy probe silently skipped Opera/LibreWolf. It is now a
   single `CHROMIUM_COOKIE_FNS` constant, so diagnostics match reality.

### Tests

Added `tests/test_review_fixes.py` (45 tests) covering the version-match
decision matrix and the new protected-file version hold, the zip-slip
containment guard and the recent-mtime protect window, `cmd_hook`'s exit-code
contract, `get_session` auth/sandbox/retry behavior, `find_linked_folder`
walk + shared-level skip + auto-link dispatch, `save-cookie` normalization,
the `0700` data-dir hardening, `install`/`uninstall` settings.json hook
surgery (`_is_our_hook` + idempotency), and version single-sourcing. Suite:
77 tests. Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running them across Python
3.8–3.13 (plus a build + `twine check` job).

## 0.3.2 — 2026-05-15

Patch release. Addresses the `overleaf-sync-now login` flow getting blocked
by Google's *"This browser or app may not be secure"* page when the user's
Overleaf account is registered via "Sign in with Google."

**Cause.** Google's `disallowed_useragent` gate detects automated browsers
through multiple signals; the dominant one in late 2025 is the CDP
`Runtime.Enable` leak that Playwright triggers when it attaches. Stripping
`--enable-automation` and patching `navigator.webdriver` (the classic
"stealth" recipe) doesn't address that leak, so the same Playwright code
that worked in 2024 fails in 2025-2026.

**Fix.**

1. **Preferred launch backend: [patchright](https://github.com/Kaliiiiiiiiii-Vinyzu/patchright-python).**
   patchright is a maintained Playwright fork that patches the
   `Runtime.Enable` / `Console.Enable` CDP leaks and the command-flag
   fingerprint set. Same `sync_playwright` API, drop-in. Added as a
   conditional dep (`python_version >= '3.9'`; patchright's wheel doesn't
   support 3.8). Vanilla Playwright stays as a fallback for 3.8 installs
   and for environments where the patchright wheel isn't available. A new
   `_import_sync_playwright()` adapter picks whichever is loaded. When
   falling back to vanilla Playwright the launch call still passes
   `ignore_default_args=["--enable-automation"]` + the
   `AutomationControlled` blink flag as a best-effort baseline.
2. **Google-block detector.** `cmd_login`'s wait loop watches `page.url`
   for `signin/rejected` / `disallowed_useragent`. On hit, it skips the
   5-minute cookie-detection timeout and prints a tailored recovery
   message pointing the user at
   `https://www.overleaf.com/user/password/reset` — the official Overleaf
   workaround for accounts originally registered via Google, ORCID, or
   Twitter. After setting an Overleaf-specific password, re-running
   `login` and using email+password sidesteps Google entirely.
3. **Docs.** `docs/authentication.md` adds a new section on the Google
   block and the password escape hatch. `docs/troubleshooting.md` adds a
   row for the symptom. `SKILL.md` adds a sub-section to the auth-failure
   recovery flow so the AI playbook tells the user the right thing
   instead of looping on `login` retries.

**Caveats.**

- patchright improves the odds Google's gate doesn't fire, but it's not a
  guarantee — Google iterates against bypasses. The password-reset path
  is the permanently stable workaround for Google-SSO users; everything
  else is best-effort.
- Disk: after upgrading, existing installs may briefly hold both
  Playwright's and patchright's ~150 MB Chromium binaries (separate
  caches). The old Playwright Chromium goes unused but isn't auto-removed
  — it may still be in use by other Playwright-based projects on the
  same machine.
- Org/enterprise SSO accounts (Overleaf for Education / SAML / Shibboleth)
  can't use the password-reset path; their fallback is `save-cookie`.
  Not addressed in this release.

No CLI surface change. No data format change. Drop-in upgrade.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-04-26

Patch release. Three fixes uncovered by post-0.3.0 testing and code review.

**1. Layer 6b fingerprint sanity gate: stop false-positive-warning on
file renames or moves.** In 0.3.0 the warning fired any time recent
dropbox-origin pathnames in `/updates` didn't exist at the *exact* path
locally. That misfires on the common rename/move case: a historic entry
for `Paper-New.tex` still references the project root, but the file now
lives at `Archive/Paper-New.tex`. The link is correct and sync did the
right thing — but the warning cried wolf, eroding trust for the real
wrong-project case it's meant to catch. Fix: add a **basename fallback**.
If the exact path isn't there, look for the file's basename anywhere
under the folder (one bounded `os.walk`, built lazily and only when at
least one direct match failed; dotdirs like `.git/` skipped). The
wrong-project case is still caught — an unrelated project almost never
shares basenames across all of its recent activity, and Layers 2 and 4
already cover the vast majority of wrong-project scenarios. The same
basename-fallback logic is shared by Layer 6a's ambiguity disambiguator,
so it too becomes lenient on renamed-file scenarios.

**2. Marker shadowing at the `Apps/Overleaf/` level.** If a user dropped
`.overleaf-project` directly inside `~/Dropbox/Apps/Overleaf/` (instead
of inside a specific project subfolder, easy to do by running `link`
from the wrong cwd), the parent walk in `find_linked_folder` would
silently bind every project under that folder to the same project ID.
Fix: `find_linked_folder` now detects when a marker is at the shared
`Apps/Overleaf/` level (case-insensitive, `Apps`/`apps`,
`Overleaf`/`overleaf`), prints a one-line WARN with the suggested
correct location, and skips that marker so the parent walk falls
through to per-project auto-link.

**3. Module docstring caught up to current behavior.** The auth chain
section listed the wrong order and was missing both `_try_login_profile`
(the load-bearing Chrome 130+ Windows path, FIRST after cached cookies)
and `rookiepy`. The project-folder-mapping section described the v0.0.x
"manual marker only" model rather than the v0.3.0 auto-link/auto-write
flow with policy resolution and fingerprint disambiguation. Both
rewritten to match the code.

4 new unit tests (3 for basename fallback in the fingerprint check,
1 for marker-shadowing detection). Total suite: 32 tests.

No CLI surface change. No data format change. Drop-in upgrade.

## 0.3.0 — 2026-04-26

Robust project resolution. Fixes a class of silent-wrong-project bugs whose
canonical instance was reported as: an Overleaf account with two projects of
the same name (one trashed) silently auto-linked to the trashed one, so
`sync` returned `no_change` while the active project had fresh edits.

The single-line dict overwrite in `_refresh_index()` was the proximate cause,
but the resolver was the architectural problem: it threw away every
disambiguating field (`trashed`, `archived`, `lastUpdated`, `ownerId`) and
had no read-side validation gate. This release rebuilds resolution as seven
independent layers so that no single failure mode produces a wrong-project
sync.

**The seven layers:**

1. **Richer project index format (v2).** `~/.overleaf-sync/projects.json` now
   stores the full record per project (`id`, `name`, `trashed`, `archived`,
   `lastUpdated`, `ownerId`) instead of a `{name: id}` dict. v1 files on
   disk are treated as expired and re-fetched on first use.
2. **Policy resolver, refuse on ambiguity.** Auto-link filters out trashed
   and archived projects by default and tries case-sensitive exact match
   before falling back to case-insensitive. When two non-trashed projects
   share a name, the resolver refuses to guess and prints all candidates
   (with IDs and `lastUpdated`) plus the exact `link <id> <folder>` command
   to copy-paste. The previous behavior — silently picking whichever the
   dict's last write wrote — was the proximate cause of the reported bug.
3. **Auto-write `.overleaf-project` marker on successful auto-link.** Once
   resolution is unambiguous, the marker is persisted in the folder so
   subsequent syncs are immune to later renames, newly-trashed duplicates,
   or anything else that mutates the projects list. Marker now carries
   `linked_at`, `name_at_link_time`, and `source` (`auto-link` /
   `auto-link-fingerprint` / `link`) for debuggability. Old markers
   containing just `{"project_id": "..."}` still resolve identically.
4. **Validate marker against the cached index on every resolution.** No
   extra network call. Surfaces the cases the earlier layers can't reach
   on their own: marker pointing at a project that's now trashed, archived,
   deleted, or owned by a different account (e.g. cookies switched). Warns
   to stderr but proceeds — the user explicitly wrote the marker, so we
   never refuse to sync, we just stop being silent.
5. **Better `status` and `projects` output.** `projects` now shows columns
   `NAME | PROJECT_ID | FLAGS | LAST_UPDATED`, sorted by `lastUpdated`
   desc, with inline flags `T` (trashed), `A` (archived), `DUP` (name
   shared with another project). `status` shows resolution provenance
   (marker file vs auto-link), the project's current name from the index,
   `lastUpdated`, and any trashed/archived flag.
6. **(a) Fingerprint-based ambiguity disambiguation.** When the policy
   resolver returns "ambiguous," probes each candidate's `/updates` top
   page (one HTTP request per candidate, only on ambiguity) and counts how
   many recent dropbox-origin pathnames exist as local files. If exactly
   one candidate has matches and the rest have zero, picks it
   automatically — converting the reported bug into auto-resolved-correctly
   even before the trashed filter would refuse. Falls back to the layer-2
   refusal when fingerprints don't disambiguate.
7. **(b) Fingerprint sanity gate on every sync.** Inside `refresh_project`,
   before returning `no_change`, walks the top dropbox-origin entries from
   `/updates` and warns to stderr if none of their pathnames map to local
   files. Catches the only failure class the earlier layers can't: right
   account, valid non-trashed project, but the wrong project (typo'd
   manual `link`, fork, etc.). Cost: ~10 `Path.exists()` calls; no extra
   network.

**Other 0.3.0 changes:**

- **Concurrency safety for atomic writes.** Both `_atomic_write_text`
  (used for state, versions, projects index, cookie cache, marker, and
  `~/.claude/settings.json`) and `_extract_files` (used to write zip
  contents into the project folder) had concurrency bugs that triggered
  when two PreToolUse hooks fired on the same project — e.g. two Codex
  CLI windows editing the same paper:
  - **Tempfile name collision.** The previous names were deterministic
    (`<path>.tmp`) and PID-only (`<file>.tmp-<pid>`). Two writers in the
    same process or across rapid PID-reuse could open the same tempfile
    in `w` mode and stomp each other's writes.
  - **Windows `ACCESS_DENIED` on contending `os.replace`.** When two
    processes call `MoveFileEx` against the same target near-simultaneously,
    one transiently fails. The original code would propagate this as a
    "refresh failed" hook error even though the target was correctly
    written by the other process.
  Both helpers now share `_unique_tmp_path` (PID + 8 random hex chars)
  and `_replace_with_retry` (jittered exponential backoff up to ~700ms).
  New `ConcurrencyTests` exercise 20-thread contention on `_atomic_write_text`,
  10-thread contention on `_extract_files`, and 10-thread contention on
  marker writes — all stable across stress runs.
- **Documented lost-update semantics.** `state.json` and `versions.json`
  are read-modify-write — two processes updating *different* keys at
  exactly the same moment can lose one update (last-writer-wins on the
  whole file). Effect on `state.json` is debounce-timestamp drift
  (harmless). Effect on `versions.json` is that the lost project's
  cached `toV` reverts to absent, triggering a bootstrap on next sync —
  bandwidth-wasteful (full zip download) but not destructive (the
  hash-diff + `protect_recent_seconds` guards keep local edits safe).
  Per-key locking would eliminate this but adds cross-platform
  complexity for a benign loss; not implemented.
- `_extract_files` now skips any zip entry whose basename is
  `.overleaf-project`. Defense in depth: if Overleaf's Dropbox bridge
  uploads a marker to the project, it can never overwrite a different
  machine's local marker on the next zip download.
- **POSIX `0o600` for every file under the data dir.** Previously only
  `cookies.json` was permission-restricted; `versions.json`, `state.json`,
  `projects.json`, and `.validated-at` all leaked project IDs, names,
  and ownership metadata to other local users on shared POSIX boxes.
  The atomic-write path now applies `0o600` to anything written under
  `<DATA_DIR>` (per `_is_under_data_dir`), but leaves `.overleaf-project`
  markers in user folders at default perms so Dropbox can still read
  them. New POSIX-only `FilePermsTests` cover both halves.
- **Hang-proof `/project` fetch.** `_refresh_projects_records` now passes
  `timeout=15` (matching `fetch_updates`) and converts a sandbox-block
  socket error into the existing `_SANDBOX_HINT` instead of letting the
  `requests` exception propagate. Previously a network stall during the
  daily project-list refresh could hang the hook indefinitely.
- **`doctor` is crash-proof.** Wrapped `find_linked_folder` in `cmd_doctor`
  with try/except so a malformed cwd or transient resolver error
  produces a clean diagnostic line rather than a Python traceback.
  Doctor must be the most robust command — it's what users run when
  things are already broken.
- Docs: `architecture.md` and `operations.md` now describe the data-dir
  resolution order (`$OVERLEAF_SYNC_DATA_DIR` → `~/.claude/overleaf-data/`
  → `~/.overleaf-sync/`) instead of hard-coding the legacy path.
  Architecture page also documents the new auto-link / marker /
  fingerprint flow.
- `cmd_link` writes the marker via the new `_write_marker` helper (atomic
  write, with metadata) and warns up front if the supplied project ID is
  trashed, archived, or missing from the cached index.
- The hook (which fires on every keystroke) suppresses Layer 4 marker
  validation warnings to avoid spam. Layer 6b's sanity warning still
  fires through the hook path. Interactive `status` and `sync` print
  full diagnostics.
- New unit tests under `tests/` cover the policy resolver, index
  migration, fingerprint matcher, and marker round-trip behavior. Run
  with `python -m unittest discover tests`.

**Migration:** existing `~/.overleaf-sync/projects.json` files are detected
as v1 and refreshed automatically on first use. Existing
`.overleaf-project` markers (containing only `project_id`) keep working
unchanged. No user action required.

## 0.2.2 — 2026-04-25

Positioning. Lead with the failure mode this tool actually solves, instead of with a category label ("agent skill") that the search results show is now table stakes.

- **README opener**: subtitle is now a single literal sentence describing the failure — *"Stops Claude Code and Codex CLI from silently overwriting your Overleaf web edits with a stale local Dropbox copy."* New "The failure mode" section above the install block walks through the bug concretely (10–20 min Dropbox poll, AI reads stale file, edits round-trip, web edits vanish, success reported).
- **`pyproject.toml description`** rewritten to lead with the same failure-mode sentence. PyPI search and AI assistants weight this field heavily.
- **`CITATION.cff title`** reframed: *"stop AI coding agents from overwriting Overleaf web edits with a stale local Dropbox copy"* — replaces the older "instant Overleaf-to-Dropbox sync" wording.
- **GitHub repo description** updated via API to match.
- **README's "Related projects"** section is now a comparison table including `aloth/overleaf-skill` (the namesake collision on npm/Homebrew), the major Overleaf MCP servers, and olsync. Lays out who keeps Dropbox vs. replaces it, and who fires automatically vs. manually. We're the only row with ✅ on both.

No code change.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-04-25

Discoverability metadata. No functional change.

- `pyproject.toml` description reframed as "Overleaf sync skill for Claude Code and Codex CLI" (previously led with the implementation detail). Lifts "skill" / "Claude Code" / "Codex CLI" into the first line — these are the high-intent search terms users actually type, and PyPI / Google index that field heavily.
- `pyproject.toml` keywords reorganized and expanded: added `overleaf-skill`, `claude-skill`, `claude-code-skill`, `codex-skill`, `ai-skill`. Existing keywords preserved.
- `README.md` opening: H1 subtitle and lede paragraph now lead with "Overleaf sync skill for Claude Code & Codex CLI" and explicitly name the failure mode it fixes ("AI agent reads stale local Dropbox copy and silently overwrites fresh web edits"). Front-loads the search terms users actually type.
- GitHub topics expanded to include `overleaf-skill`, `claude-skill`, `claude-code-skill`, `codex-skill` (set via API, not in the repo).
- GitHub repo description updated to match the new positioning.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-04-25

Cleanup release. The codebase, CLI surface, and docs are now exclusively the version-match refresh path.

- Removed `sync --legacy` (and the supporting `trigger_sync` / `fetch_csrf` functions), `sync --no-wait`, and the `MANUAL_WAIT_SECONDS` constant. The CLI surface is now just `sync [folder] [--force]`.
- `package.description`, the module docstring, `SKILL.md`, `README.md`, `CITATION.cff`, and `docs/*` rewritten to describe only the current refresh path. No conditional or "kept as fallback" framing remains.
- Internal cleanup: `_data_dir()` variable rename, comment polish, removal of the `--legacy` hint in `doctor`'s probe-failed branch.

No behavioral change for any user who wasn't passing `--legacy` / `--no-wait`.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-04-24

Diagnostic polish for sandboxed shells (Codex CLI, some CI runners).

- **Sandbox-block detection** in every network-using subcommand. `WinError 10013` / `forbidden by its access permissions` / `EACCES` / `EPERM` / "Permission denied" at the socket layer raise a specific hint ("Outbound HTTPS to Overleaf was blocked by the host environment ... approve the command in your sandbox policy") instead of a generic network error.
- `get_session` probes connectivity before raising "No valid Overleaf cookies" so a sandbox block doesn't steer the AI agent into a pointless `setup` / `login` / `doctor` loop (they all hit the same blocked socket).
- `status` prints `Cookie auth: UNKNOWN — outbound HTTPS is blocked ...` instead of a misleading `INVALID` verdict when the probe can't run.
- `sync` catches `RuntimeError` cleanly — the sandbox hint reaches the user as a one-line `ERROR:` message, not a Python traceback.
- The PreToolUse hook distinguishes sandbox errors from transient failures: no more "will retry after debounce" for errors that won't self-heal.
- New **Sandbox notes** section in `SKILL.md` telling the AI playbook-reader not to reach for auth-recovery commands when the failure shape is an outbound-socket permission problem.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-04-24

Switched the default refresh path from `POST /project/<id>/dropbox/sync-now` to a cheap version-match probe + selective zip extract. The old endpoint enqueued a per-user "poll Dropbox" job in Overleaf's `tpdsworker` queue, which is serialized with webhook-triggered per-file updates coming the other direction; frequent AI-edit hooks therefore starved local→Overleaf propagation of queue slots, making users' own local saves feel slower *after* installing the tool than before. See `services/web/app/src/Features/ThirdPartyDataStore/TpdsUpdateSender.mjs` in the open-source Overleaf repo for the comment that confirms this.

**The new path:**

- `GET /project/<id>/updates` is the probe (~0.3 s, ~30 KB). Returns the version history with per-update pathnames and an `origin.kind` field.
- Cached `toV` per project in `versions.json`; if latest `toV` matches, exit.
- Walk updates from latest back to cached `toV`; skip updates whose `origin.kind === "dropbox"` — those are the local→Dropbox→Overleaf round-trips of our own saves, and local already has the content.
- Only when something web-origin remains do we `GET /download/zip` and extract just the changed pathnames, writing atomically and skipping any file whose bytes already match local.
- Web-origin edits show up in `/updates` within ~0.5 s of the edit committing on Overleaf — measured, not estimated.

**Other 0.1.0 changes:**

- New `sync --force` flag: always download the zip and re-extract, bypassing version-match.
- **Bootstrap**: on first run with no cached `toV` for a project, the tool downloads the zip once to guarantee local is in sync (hash-compare keeps Dropbox upload pressure at zero when local already matches).
- **Data-safety guard**: the extraction step never overwrites a local file modified in the last 30 seconds. Closes a race where Dropbox hasn't yet pushed the user's in-progress local save up to Overleaf, so the zip would have stale content. Pass `--force` to disable.
- **Hook matcher extended to Read**: `Read|Edit|Write|MultiEdit` (was `Edit|Write|MultiEdit`). The cheap `/updates` probe makes refresh-on-read affordable, and it keeps Claude's reasoning grounded in current content rather than stale reads. Existing installs need `overleaf-sync-now install` re-run once to pick up the new matcher in `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- **Defensive cache-ahead branch**: if local cache claims we've synced to a higher `toV` than Overleaf currently reports (corruption, cross-machine drift, history rewind), the refresh re-bootstraps instead of silently reporting a backwards version delta.
- **Diagnostics**: `status` reports `Cached toV`; `doctor` adds a `[5]` section probing `/updates` end-to-end.

## 0.0.1 — 2026-04-19

First public release. See the [v0.0.1 release notes](https://github.com/hanlulong/overleaf-sync-now/releases/tag/v0.0.1) for the full feature list.
