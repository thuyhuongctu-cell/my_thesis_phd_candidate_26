"""overleaf-sync-now CLI.

Subcommands:
  install                       Link skill into Claude Code/Codex + add hook + run setup
  login                         Open a controlled browser to log into Overleaf and capture
                                the cookie via DevTools Protocol (the proper fix for Chrome
                                130+ app-bound encryption). One-time, persists for weeks.
  setup                         Auth setup (auto-detect from existing browsers/profiles)
  save-cookie <value>           Persist a manually-pasted overleaf_session2 cookie value
  link <project_id> [folder]    Mark a folder as belonging to an Overleaf project (override)
  sync [folder] [--force]       Refresh the linked folder against Overleaf. Probes
                                /project/<id>/updates and downloads the zip only when
                                a web-origin change has actually happened. --force always
                                re-extracts.
  status [folder]               Show data dir, cookie validity, and link/sync state
  projects [--refresh]          List your Overleaf projects (name + ID)
  doctor                        Verbose diagnostic dump of the auth chain
  hook                          PreToolUse hook entrypoint (reads JSON from stdin)
  uninstall                     Remove skill links and hook (cookies preserved)

Auth chain (first hit wins): cached cookies -> persistent `login` browser
profile (the proper Chrome 130+ Windows fix) -> rookiepy (Rust cookie reader,
Chrome 127+ friendly) -> browser_cookie3 (legacy DPAPI) -> Claude Code's
Playwright profile -> interactive paste prompt (setup/login only).

Project-folder mapping (since 0.3.0):
  1. `.overleaf-project` marker file in the folder, or any parent up to the
     filesystem root, takes priority. Validated against the cached projects
     index (warns on trashed/archived/missing-from-account).
  2. Else, if the file lives under <anywhere>/Apps/Overleaf/<project>/, the
     resolver looks up <project> in the cached project records (filtering
     trashed/archived; refusing to guess when two living projects share a
     name; auto-resolving via fingerprint match against /updates Dropbox-
     origin pathnames when ambiguous; auto-writing the marker on success).
  3. Else, no link — the hook exits 0 (other tools pass through).

Refresh flow:
  1. GET /project/<id>/updates -- cheap probe (~0.3s, ~30 KB) that returns the
     version history with per-update pathnames and origin.
  2. If latest toV == cached toV for this project: no-op.
  3. Else walk updates back to cached toV; skip updates with origin.kind="dropbox"
     (those are the local->Dropbox->Overleaf round-trips of our own saves).
  4. If anything web-origin remains, GET /project/<id>/download/zip and extract
     only the affected pathnames, writing atomically and only when content
     actually differs from local (so Dropbox upload pressure stays at zero
     when local already matches).
