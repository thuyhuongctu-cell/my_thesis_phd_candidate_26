## Skills

### `review-paper` — Pre-Submission Referee Report

Runs a rigorous pre-submission review of an academic paper, simulating the scrutiny of a specific journal's editorial board. Six specialized review agents run in parallel and consolidate their findings into a single structured report.

**What it reviews:**

| Agent | Focus |
|---|---|
| 1 | Spelling, grammar, and academic style |
| 2 | Internal consistency and cross-reference verification |
| 3 | Unsupported claims and identification integrity |
| 4 | Mathematics, equations, and notation |
| 5 | Tables, figures, and their documentation |
| 6 | Contribution evaluation (adversarial journal-specific referee) |

**Installation:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands && curl -o ~/.claude/commands/review-paper.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/claesbackman/AI-research-feedback/main/Skills/review-paper.md
```

For a project-local install:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/commands && curl -o .claude/commands/review-paper.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/claesbackman/AI-research-feedback/main/Skills/review-paper.md
```

**Usage:**

```text
/review-paper
/review-paper QJE
/review-paper JF path/to/main.tex
```

**Supported journals:**

| Category | Journals |
|---|---|
| Top-5 economics | `AER`, `QJE`, `JPE`, `Econometrica`, `REStud` |
| Finance | `JF`, `JFE`, `RFS`, `JFQA` |
| Macro | `AEJMacro`, `JME`, `RED` |

If no journal is specified, the command applies high general standards without a specific journal persona. If no path is provided, it auto-detects the main `.tex` file.

**Output:**

Saves a consolidated report to `PRE_SUBMISSION_REVIEW_[YYYY-MM-DD].md` in the current directory, automatically appending `-v2`, `-v3`, and so on if a file already exists.

**Customization:**

- Add journals or fields by editing the recognized journal names list in the skill file.
- Add project-specific context in your prompt or in a local `CLAUDE.md` file.
- Adjust folder discovery or save paths directly in the skill if your project structure differs from the default assumptions.

**Requirements:**

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with access to the `general-purpose` subagent.
- A LaTeX paper. The skill reads `.tex` files and optionally inspects figure and table files.

### `review-paper-light` — Quick Paper Check

Runs a fast 2-agent pre-submission check for an economics paper. It focuses on contribution, identification, causal overclaiming, and unsupported claims, and is designed for quick iteration before a full review.

**Installation:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands && curl -o ~/.claude/commands/review-paper-light.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/claesbackman/AI-research-feedback/main/Skills/review-paper-light.md
```

For a project-local install:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/commands && curl -o .claude/commands/review-paper-light.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/claesbackman/AI-research-feedback/main/Skills/review-paper-light.md
```

**Usage:**

```text
/review-paper-light
/review-paper-light path/to/main.tex
```

If no path is provided, the command auto-detects the main `.tex` file.

**Output:**

Saves a short prioritized report to `QUICK_REVIEW_[YYYY-MM-DD].md` in the current directory, automatically versioning the filename if one already exists.

**Requirements:**

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with access to the `general-purpose` subagent.
- A LaTeX paper.

### `review-paper-code` — Paper-Code Reproducibility Review

Runs a paper-code review for empirical research projects. It discovers the main LaTeX paper and analysis code, checks reproducibility and code quality, maps the paper's main empirical claims to the code, and writes a constructive report highlighting strengths, gaps to verify, and concrete next steps.

**What it reviews:**

| Area | Focus |
|---|---|
| Paper discovery | Main `.tex` file and included sections |
| Code discovery | Stata, R, and Python scripts in common analysis folders |
| Reproducibility | Paths, seeds, outputs, dependencies, run order, documentation |
| Code quality | Structure, commented-out code, opaque transforms, major thresholds |
| Paper-code alignment | Tables, variables, sample restrictions, methods, clustering, fixed effects |

**Usage:**

```text
/review-paper-code
/review-paper-code path/to/main.tex
/review-paper-code path/to/main.tex path/to/code_dir
/review-paper-code path/to/main.tex path/to/code_dir full
```

**Review depth:**

- `main`: default; focuses on main scripts and core outputs
- `full`: reviews all detected code files in scope

**Output:**

Writes a report to `code_review_report.md` in the current working directory.

**Requirements:**

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with access to the `general-purpose` subagent.
- A LaTeX paper plus Stata, R, or Python analysis code.

### `review-pap` — Pre-Analysis Plan Review

Runs a 6-agent pre-submission review of a pre-analysis plan (PAP). The command auto-detects the main PAP and supporting files, then evaluates writing quality, specification completeness, internal consistency, identification strategy, statistical analysis, implementation details, and registry or journal fit.

**Installation:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands && curl -o ~/.claude/commands/review-pap.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/claesbackman/AI-research-feedback/main/Skills/review-pap.md
```

For a project-local install:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/commands && curl -o .claude/commands/review-pap.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/claesbackman/AI-research-feedback/main/Skills/review-pap.md
```

**Usage:**

```text
/review-pap
/review-pap AEA
/review-pap QJE path/to/pap.tex
```

**Supported targets:**

- Trial registries: `AEA`, `EGAP`, `OSF`, `ClinicalTrials`, `ISRCTN`
- Journal standards: `AER`, `QJE`, `JPE`, `RESTUD`, `AEJ`, `JEEA`
- General standards: `top-journal`, `working-paper`

If no target is specified, the command defaults to `top-journal`. If no path is provided, it auto-detects the main PAP file.

**Supporting files it can inspect:**

- Power calculations and sample-size worksheets
- Survey instruments and questionnaires
- Randomization protocols and sampling frames
- Code skeletons and mock tables
- Data dictionaries and ethics materials

**Output:**

Saves a consolidated report to `PAP_REVIEW_[YYYY-MM-DD].md` in the current directory.

**Requirements:**

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with access to the `general-purpose` subagent.
- A PAP in a readable format such as `.md`, `.txt`, or `.tex`. The skill can also attempt to work with `.pdf` and `.docx`, while noting accessibility limitations if needed.

### `review-grant` — Grant Proposal Review

Runs a 6-agent pre-submission panel review of a grant proposal. The command auto-detects the main proposal and supporting documents, then evaluates clarity, compliance signals, internal consistency, significance, innovation, research design, feasibility, budget logic, team readiness, and fit to the target funder or program.

**Installation:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands && curl -o ~/.claude/commands/review-grant.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/claesbackman/AI-research-feedback/main/Skills/review-grant.md
```

For a project-local install:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/commands && curl -o .claude/commands/review-grant.md \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/claesbackman/AI-research-feedback/main/Skills/review-grant.md
```

**Usage:**

```text
/review-grant
/review-grant NSF
/review-grant NIH path/to/proposal.pdf
```

**Supported funders/programs:**

- US federal science and health: `NSF`, `NIH`, `ERC`, `HorizonEurope`
- General proposal standards: `major-funder`, `foundation`

If no target is specified, the command defaults to `major-funder`. If no path is provided, it auto-detects the main proposal file.

**Supporting files it can inspect:**

- Budgets and budget justifications
- Timelines and workplans
- Biosketches, CVs, and personnel documents
- Data-management plans, mentoring plans, and facilities statements
- Letters of support, appendices, and supplementary materials

**Output:**

Saves a consolidated report to `GRANT_PROPOSAL_REVIEW_[YYYY-MM-DD].md` in the current directory.

**Requirements:**

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with access to the `general-purpose` subagent.
- A proposal in a readable format such as `.md`, `.txt`, or `.tex`. The skill can also attempt to work with `.pdf` and `.docx`, while noting accessibility limitations if needed.
