# Empirical Claims Audit — v1.6 to v1.7

This document records each specific empirical claim made in v1.6 (after the AI flagged fabrication risk), the verified value computed from the actual data, and the v1.7 fix.

## Verification source

All verified numbers in this document come from `python/audit_v1_6_claims.py` run against the built analytic CSVs (`built_2012_all.csv`, `built_2024_all.csv`, `built_2012_mfg.csv`, `built_2024_mfg.csv`).

Random-seed-free OLS / Heckman / Paternoster / joint F computations using `statsmodels` and `scipy.stats`.

## Substantive interpretation changes from v1.6 to v1.7

### Heckman selection caveat (Section 3.6 / Section 4.7)

The 2012 IMR is significant (z = −2.44, p = .015), which means selection into the analytic sample is correlated with unobservables that also affect labour productivity. v1.6 incorrectly stated the opposite ("indistinguishable from zero" — fabricated). The v1.7 reframing:

1. Reports the verified IMR value and acknowledges the implication.
2. Notes that re-estimating M2 with the IMR included as a control changes the FSTS coefficient by less than 0.10 in absolute value (still verified) and preserves the inverted-U (Lind-Mehlum p < .001).
3. Explicitly tells readers to weight the 2012 results with the selection caveat in mind.

This is a **substantively different finding** from v1.6 and **users should be aware of it**.

### ISIC 2-digit FE sensitivity (Section 4.7)

The within-sector specification reduces the FSTS coefficient by 12.8 % and FSTS² by 15.2 % — non-trivial but does not flip the sign or location of the inverted-U. v1.6 understated this sensitivity. v1.7 reports the actual percentages and notes the sensitivity for readers focused on within-sector dynamics.

### Panel-firm exclusion (Section 4.7)

Shift of 1.9 pp in the pooled TP is moderate but bigger than the v1.6 claim of <0.5 pp. v1.7 reports the verified shift; the qualitative threshold-stability conclusion is preserved.

### Mfg-only Paternoster (Section 4.6)

The verified Paternoster z values (+1.51 / −0.96, both p > .10) are weaker than v1.6 claimed but still **fail to reject** cross-wave equality. The qualitative conclusion is preserved.

## Items still flagged for future verification

The following claims in v1.7 have not been independently audited via re-running. They should be spot-checked before final submission:

1. The Lind-Mehlum U-test p-values (p < .001 for 2012 / pooled; p = .037 for 2024).
2. The TCI z-standardised level-shift coefficients (β_z = +0.260, +0.426, +0.380).
3. The DAI z-standardised level-shift coefficients (β_z = +0.05 to +0.13).
4. The Paternoster z = −2.55 on cross-wave change in TCI in Section 4.4 / Section 5.2.
5. The three-way moderation joint F values (F1 = 2.24, F2 = 3.26, F3 = 0.27).

## Recommendation

Before final submission, run `python/audit_v1_6_claims.py` end-to-end on the revised v1.7 specifications and confirm that all numerical claims in Section 3.6, Section 4.2–Section 4.7 match the script output to two decimal places.
