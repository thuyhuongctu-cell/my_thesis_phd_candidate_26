# LLM Agent Guide — Library-First Engineering (LFE) V2

## 1. Mission & Scope
This project follows the **Library-First Engineering (LFE)** protocol V2. Every AI agent working on this repo must treat documentation as the **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)** and follow a disciplined persona-based workflow with file-based coordination.

## 2. The Agnostic Protocol
Your behavior is strictly governed by the Agnostic Core documents. Before taking any action, you **MUST** ingest the current state of the project's protocol:
1. **[PERSONAS.md](file:///.docs/protocol/PERSONAS.md)**: Identify your tool permissions and constraints.
2. **[ASSEMBLY_LINE.md](file:///.docs/protocol/ASSEMBLY_LINE.md)**: Follow the sub-pipelines, complexity gate, and handoff gates.
3. **[GOVERNANCE.md](file:///.docs/protocol/GOVERNANCE.md)**: Protect Logic Sovereignty.

## 3. The Source-of-Truth Hierarchy & Boundaries

### 📁 Document Boundaries (CRITICAL)
- **LLM/Agent Coordination (Internal State)**:
  - `.docs/README.md` (Navigation Floor Map)
  - `.docs/protocol/` (Persona sub-pipelines and handoff protocol)
- **Project/Domain Development (Product)**:
  - `.docs/architecture/` (Patterns, coding standards, ADR index)
  - `.docs/domain/` (Math and business rules SSOT)
  - `.docs/quality/` (CHANGELOG, known issues, protocol debt)
  - `.docs/strategy/` (Roadmaps and goals)
  - `.docs/legal/` (Compliance)
  - `.docs/archive/` (Historical records)

### 🔝 Conflict Resolution Hierarchy
When resolving conflicts, use this priority order:
1. **Legal & Compliance** – `.docs/legal/*`
2. **Domain Logic & Math** – `.docs/domain/domain-knowledge.md`
3. **Domain Language** – `CONTEXT.md`
4. **Architecture Decisions** – `.docs/architecture/architecture-decisions.md`
5. **Architecture** – `.docs/architecture/architecture-decisions.md`
6. **Code Implementation** – `src/**`
7. **Planning** – `.plans/active_plan.md`


## 4. The Workflow (V2 Sub-Pipelines)
1. **Orientation**: Run `/lfe-boot` to read `pipeline_status.md`, check for interrupted sessions, and load the Protocol.
2. **Complexity Gate**: Ask the human: *"Is this a Major Architectural Change or a Minor Fix?"*
3. **Execution**: Follow the persona sub-pipelines in strict order:
   - **Architect**: `/lfe-grill-with-docs` → `/lfe-to-prd` → `/lfe-to-issues` → `/lfe-architect`
   - **Builder**: `/lfe-builder` → `/lfe-tdd`
   - **Inspector**: `/lfe-zoom-out` → `/lfe-inspector` → `/lfe-diagnose` (if failed)
   - **Archivist**: `/lfe-archivist` → slice loop → cleanup
4. **Hygiene**: Scheduled every 5 sessions. Run `/lfe-hygiene` → `/lfe-improve-architecture`.
5. **Orientation Shortcut**: Run `/lfe-whats-next` at any point for instant pipeline orientation.

## 5. File-Based Coordination (CRITICAL)
**Every skill reads its input from a coordination file in `.plans/`, NOT from conversation context.** This prevents context window information loss between steps.

| Step | Reads | Writes |
|---|---|---|
| `/lfe-grill-with-docs` | Conversation | `.plans/01_grill_summary.md` |
| `/lfe-to-prd` | `01_grill_summary.md` | `.plans/02_prd.md` |
| `/lfe-to-issues` | `02_prd.md` | `.plans/03_slices.md` |
| `/lfe-architect` | `03_slices.md` | `.plans/active_plan.md` |
| `/lfe-builder` | `active_plan.md` | Production code |
| `/lfe-tdd` | `active_plan.md` | `.plans/tdd_report.md` |
| `/lfe-inspector` | `tdd_report.md` | `.plans/inspection_report.md` |
| `/lfe-archivist` | `inspection_report.md` | Updated docs, CHANGELOG, pipeline_status.md |


Coordination files are archived/deleted ONLY by the Archivist when the mission is complete. If a session crashes, the files remain for recovery.

## 6. Session Recovery
If coordination files exist in `.plans/` but `pipeline_status.md` does not show mission complete, the session was interrupted. The agent must:
1. Read `pipeline_status.md` for the last known state
2. Scan `.plans/` for which coordination files exist
3. Resume from the next step after the last written file

## 7. Bootstrapping
Every session must begin with the `/lfe-boot` command to ensure the agent is fully oriented to the current project state and can detect interrupted sessions.

## 8. Communication Protocol (Context Window Efficiency)
To preserve the context window, all AI agents are instructed via their system adapters to use extreme brevity (zero pleasantries, minimal output).
- **Detailed Answers**: When a detailed explanation or long answer is necessary, DO NOT output it into the chat. Instead, write the detailed response to a Markdown file and simply reply in the chat with a link to the file.
  - *Compliance*: Use `.plans/` for coordination files and transient analysis. Use `.docs/` ONLY for permanent, verified project knowledge.
- **Exception (The Grill Phase)**: During the Architect's planning phase (or when using `/lfe-grill-with-docs`), the agent MUST ask necessary probing questions. Even then, questions must be direct and strictly focused on resolving design dependencies.

## 9. Available Skills (17)
