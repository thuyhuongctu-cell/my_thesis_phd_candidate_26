## What is Library-First Engineering?

**Library-First Engineering (LFE)** is a process framework — not a library, not a CLI, not a config file. It forces humans and AI agents to collaborate through a **structured, file-based assembly line of orchestration prompts** that guard against the three failure modes of AI-assisted coding:

- **Logic hallucination** — the model invents business rules instead of reading documented ones.
- **Context decay** — long sessions drift away from earlier decisions, producing inconsistent output.
- **Spaghetti architecture** — silent entropy after dozens of "just one more change" edits.

LFE replaces fragile chat logs with a **Library of Truth**: interconnected **prompts for LLM pipeline orchestration** that act as the operating system for every persona on the project. *(Today these prompts happen to live as Markdown — that's an implementation detail. The framework treats the structure as authoritative, not the file format. As more token-efficient formats emerge, LFE will follow.)*

### Why it pays off over time

LFE is not just defensive. The same discipline that prevents bad code also lowers the operational cost of AI-assisted engineering — every session, every month, every contributor:

- **Token efficiency.** Personas load only the prompts they need (their contract + the active mission's plan + the relevant slice of the library) — never the whole codebase or chat history.
- **Lower API spend.** Smaller context per call + fewer retries + no re-explaining the project every session = a flatter cost curve as the project grows.
- **Maintainability.** New contributors — human or AI — ramp by reading the library, not by archaeology through chat logs. Onboarding cost stops scaling with the codebase.
- **Reliability.** Same prompts + same library = same architectural decisions. Outputs are reproducible because inputs are explicit.
- **Compounding leverage.** Vanilla AI-coding workflows pay the same context tax forever. LFE pays it once — to the library — and then reuses it.

In one line: **LFE keeps the per-session cost — in tokens, in attention, and in retries — from compounding into debt you can't pay back.**

> **The Diagnostic — which house are you building?**
> - 🌾 **Straw** — one-shot prompts, no specs, no tests. *Looks fine in the demo, breaks on the first real change.*
> - 🪵 **Stick** — specs scattered in chat, no governance. *Works for a sprint, then turns brittle.*
> - 🧱 **Brick** *(LFE)* — file-based plans, persona-locked workflow, independent audit. *Resists entropy; pays a discipline tax instead of a debugging tax.*

## 30-second technical summary

LFE structures all AI-assisted work into a **persona-first assembly line**. Every step reads from, and writes to, physical files — with a clear two-tier memory model:

- `.plans/` — the **short-term coordination layer** for the active mission (wiped at end-of-mission).
- `.docs/` — the **long-term brain**, a cumulative knowledge base that survives across sessions and grows with the project.

No reliance on chat context. The graph below mirrors `.docs/protocol/ASSEMBLY_LINE.md`.

![LFE Assembly Line — full pipeline with personas, sub-pipelines, bypass routes, and emergency lane](.assets/LLM-Infra.jpg)

*Short-term: personas hand off through files in `.plans/`. Long-term: the cumulative brain lives in `.docs/` and survives every session. The Complexity Gate routes minor fixes to `/lfe-scout`; everything else flows through the full assembly line. `LFE-FORCE` is the emergency lane.*

<details>
<summary><b>Click to expand — coordination layer, bypass routes, and persona tool-locking</b></summary>

**Coordination layer.** Each skill writes to a file in `.plans/` and the next skill reads it:
`01_grill_summary.md` → `02_prd.md` → `03_slices.md` → `active_plan.md` → `tdd_report.md` → `inspection_report.md`. If a session crashes, the files remain and `lfe-boot` resumes from the last step.

**Bypass routes** — when the full pipeline is overkill:

- **`/lfe-scout` (Flyweight Mode)** — the official bypass for minor fixes (typos, UI tweaks, simple bug fixes, &lt; 3 files). Forbidden from changing structure, dependencies, or core logic; auto-escalates to the Architect if any of those are required. This is the answer to "do I really need a full pipeline for a one-line fix?"
- **`LFE-FORCE`** — emergency break-glass for direct patches when no other route is viable. Logs an entry in `.docs/quality/PROTOCOL_DEBT.md` so the next session resolves the debt. See `.docs/protocol/GOVERNANCE.md`.

Personas are **tool-locked**: the Architect cannot edit code, the Builder cannot rewrite plans, the Inspector cannot edit production code, the Archivist cannot change behavior. A crashed session, a new contributor, or a different agent can resume exactly where the last one stopped.

## Architecture at a glance

When an AI agent (or a human teammate) opens an LFE repo, it asks the same **six questions** every time. The framework answers each one with a dedicated file — so context is *looked up*, never guessed:

1. **Who am I right now?** → my persona contract.
2. **What step am I on, what's next?** → the live pipeline cursor.
3. **What's in active working memory?** → the current mission's plan files.
4. **What's already true in this codebase?** → the documentation library.
5. **What am I forbidden from doing?** → the IDE rule files and governance.
6. **How should I write what I write?** → the format contracts.

**Two boundary rules** close the loop:

- **Framework surface vs. product code.** The framework lives in `.docs/`, `.plans/`, `.agents/`, and a handful of root files. Everything else is product code. Agents must not mix the two.
- **Memory has retention, not infinite scrollback.** Long-term memory lives in a **7-milestone rolling window** in `.docs/quality/CHANGELOG.md`. Short-term memory lives in `.plans/` and is wiped by the Archivist at end-of-mission. When an agent asks *"what shipped recently?"*, the answer is `CHANGELOG.md` — not chat history, not git log.

> [!TIP]
> Every question your AI agents currently improvise the answer to has a single, file-backed source of truth in LFE.

## Why LFE beats vanilla AI workflows

| Feature | Standard AI Workflow | Paid Vibe-Coding Platforms | **LFE Framework** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic source** | Scattered, often hallucinated | Inferred from prompts; no authoritative source | Centralized in `CONTEXT.md` |
| **Verification** | Self-verified by the same agent | Visual preview only | Independent Inspector audit |
| **Recovery** | Re-prompt from memory | Fork the project and retry | Resume from `.plans/` after any crash |

*Vibe-coding platforms cited: Lovable, v0, Bolt, Replit Agent.*

## The Alignment Paradox

LFE is **IDE-agnostic** by design — but the human-in-the-loop discipline shifts depending on what kind of tool you're driving. There are two distinct categories, with opposite failure modes:

- **Guided IDEs** (e.g., **Cursor**, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, Cline) — *you* stay in the driver's seat. The AI suggests inline; you accept, reject, or rewrite each diff. Failure mode: **drift**. The model interprets intent loosely, takes small liberties, and silently rewrites things you didn't ask for. Your job is to *constrain* it — set tight rules, review every diff, refuse off-scope changes.
- **Agentic applications** (e.g., **Antigravity**, Devin, Claude Code in agent mode, Cursor's agent tier) — the AI takes the wheel. You hand over a goal, walk away, come back to a finished branch. Failure mode: **excessive obedience**. The agent executes exactly what you ask — even when you ask wrong. Your job is to *write better instructions* — front-load context, define done criteria, document the domain rules it must obey.

Both categories produce broken architecture by opposite paths. LFE supplies the rails that catch drift *and* the documentation that prevents you from giving an obedient agent the wrong orders. **The framework supplies the discipline; the human still has to stay on the rails. No framework survives a driver who keeps overriding it.**

## The 5 Pillars

1. **📚 The Library System** — orchestration prompts organized as a structured library, not a dump.
2. **🧠 Persona Sovereignty** — separate thinking from doing; assign clear roles.
3. **⚖️ Logic Sovereignty** — domain rules are absolute and explicit.
4. **⏳ The Rolling Window** — archive stale context to keep working memory lean.
5. **📂 File-Based Coordination** — every step is a file, so crashes and handoffs are recoverable.

## Getting started

> LFE is a framework, not a package. There is nothing to install. You adopt the pattern in your own repo.

1. **Use this template** — click *Use this template* on the GitHub page, or:

	git clone https://github.com/StChiotis/Library-First-Engineering.git my-project

2. **Adopt the canonical layout**:
   - `.docs/` — the Library of Truth (`architecture/`, `domain/`, `protocol/`, `quality/`, `strategy/`).
   - `.agents/skills/` — persona prompts and sub-pipeline skills (`lfe-architect`, `lfe-builder`, `lfe-inspector`, `lfe-archivist`, `lfe-scout`, plus the sub-pipeline skills).
   - `.cursorrules` / `.windsurfrules` / `.clinerules` / `.antigravityrules` — IDE adapters.
   - `.plans/` — empty by default; populated per session as the transaction log.
3. **Boot LFE** — run `/lfe-boot` at the start of every session. The boot skill orients the agent, checks for an interrupted session, and offers the **Complexity Gate**: full pipeline for major changes, `/lfe-scout` for minor fixes.
4. **Run one feature end-to-end** — Architect → Builder → Inspector → Archivist. One change per session. No parallel pipelines.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Operational discipline.** Quality over quantity. **One change per session, one pipeline at a time.** Parallel pipelines defeat the file-based coordination model.

## Scaling LFE — adoption tiers

LFE is fully operational from session one with zero install. Optional enhancements add platform-level enforcement as the project matures:

| Tier | What you adopt | When |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0 — Solo** | Clone + `/lfe-boot`. No install, no config. Full pipeline enforced via skills + adapters. | Day 0 |
| **1 — Team** | Add CI/CD (GitHub Actions) as a Cloud Inspector. Add PR templates with an LFE compliance checklist. | When collaborating |
| **2 — Production** | Add `CODEOWNERS` for Logic Sovereignty paths. Add pre-commit hooks + secret scanning. | Before public release |

> [!NOTE]
> CI/CD and platform governance are **always optional**. LFE never mandates a specific toolchain. Adopt each tier only when it solves a real pain — see [`.docs/protocol/INDUSTRY_STANDARDS.md`](.docs/protocol/INDUSTRY_STANDARDS.md) for implementation references.

---

## Known limitations

LFE is honest about what it does *not* solve:

- **Real-time multi-agent races.** LFE assumes serial handoffs; concurrent agents on the same `.plans/` directory will collide.
- **Non-text artifacts.** Designs, binary assets, and data files live outside the library and need their own discipline.
- **Very small scripts in non-LFE repos.** For sub-100-line one-offs outside an LFE project, framework overhead exceeds its benefit. Inside an LFE repo, use `/lfe-scout` instead.
- **Model capability floor.** Personas enforce structure, not competence. A weak model with LFE still ships weak code — just with better paperwork.

---

## Real-world reference implementation

LFE is actively being applied to a production project. A public case study — demonstrating the full pipeline on a live codebase — is in progress and will be published in a follow up [Article on Medium](https://medium.com/@StChiotis).

Until then: all 17 skills and the Blank Canvas are fully operational today. Clone the repo and run `/lfe-extract-domain` or `/lfe-boot` to start Day 0 on your own project.
