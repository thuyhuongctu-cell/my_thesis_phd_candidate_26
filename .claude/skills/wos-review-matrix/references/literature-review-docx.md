# Literature Review DOCX

Use this reference after the Markdown and CSV review matrix has been created.

## Purpose

Write a literature review in Word `.docx` format from the completed review matrix. The review should synthesize arguments and evidence rather than list papers one by one.

## Required Structure

Use a clear academic prose structure by default:

1. 标题
2. 引言
3. 主题脉络 or 理论脉络
4. 分主题综述 sections
5. 方法与证据基础, when useful
6. 研究不足与未来方向
7. 小结
8. 参考文献

Adapt section titles to the user's topic when the topic is known.

## Writing Rules

- Write in organized paragraphs, not bullet notes, unless the user requests an outline.
- Group papers by ideas, claims, theories, mechanisms, methods, evidence types, debates, or research gaps.
- Prefer the form `观点（作者，年份）` in Chinese prose.
- Use grouped citations when several papers support one point, for example `（张三，2020；李四，2022；Smith, 2021）`.
- Use contrastive phrasing when studies disagree, for example `与此不同，...`.
- Avoid a paragraph-per-paper structure unless the collection is very small.
- Preserve uncertainty from the matrix. Use cautious language when evidence comes only from abstracts.
- Do not fabricate concepts, findings, samples, or methods absent from the matrix.
- Mention `待补充` only when the missing information materially affects the review.

## Suggested Logic

When possible, organize the body with this progression:

1. Define the topic and why it matters.
2. Identify the main theoretical or conceptual lines.
3. Compare empirical findings across studies.
4. Compare methods, data, or contexts.
5. Identify convergence, disagreement, and gaps.
6. End with implications for the user's research question.

## DOCX Output Rules

- Create a `.docx` file using python-docx or a suitable CLI tool.
- Use readable heading levels.
- Put `参考文献` at the end.
- Ensure every in-text cited work appears in the reference list when metadata is available.
- Do not cite works in the reference list that were not part of the evidence base unless the user explicitly adds them.
- If a reference cannot be formatted fully because metadata is missing, format the available fields and keep it in the reference list.

## Language

- If the user's topic and instructions are in Chinese, write the literature review in Chinese academic prose.
- If the user's topic and instructions are in English, write the literature review in English academic prose.
- Mixed-language bibliographies (Chinese + English sources) should follow the GB/T 7714-2015 sorting rules regardless of review language.
